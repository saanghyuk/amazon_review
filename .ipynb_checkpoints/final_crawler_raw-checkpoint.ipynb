       " '\\nComputer arrived packaged well. Very easy to set up, even for me who knows very little about computers. Wifi works no problem, so those that commented it didn\\'t might have had bad luck. My only complaints after using the computer for a few days is that the keyboard is awful. Very cheap and not responsive to typing. also smaller than the one pictured so do not expect a full size keyboard (it is 4.5\" by 16\")  The speakers on the computer are not worth calling speakers. If you go with this purchase, plan in your budget to buy speakers and a keyboard separately.All in all it is a good computer for the money and the screen is very large.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis is really a great value.  Looks and works like new.  Beautiful monitor, great  computer.  I love how compact it is instead of the old \"towers\".  Fits well in my small desk space.  Has wonderful features.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI tried to put the computer together and the monitor would not come on so I turned the monitor around and there was a connection that required a dvi cable.  So I ran to walmart and bought one only to find out that it would not connect to the computer.  So I ordered another dvi cable with a usb connection to the computer and have to wait two days for it to come.  In the meantime, I don't have a computer.  I don't even know if this thing is going to work.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIt was easy to set up. The base has some damage but nothing that effects the operation. Didn't come with instructions except for the Windows activation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThis is the first time I bought a computer. I never even had a laptop. I bought it to do school work. But I was like what the hell let's get a game. And this stuff is awesome play game on. I love it and and boy was  super cheap it comes with the speaker in the motherboard but you might want to buy another one cuz it's not that loud.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI really debated on how many stars to give it. Yes, it was cheap. But still...probably 2.5 stars would have been more accurate. The computer did arrive more quickly than expected. That’s about the best thing I can say for it. There were problems from the start. Just getting it to boot up for the first time was a challenge. It would go so far and freeze. I’d leave it several minutes, but nothing short of the power button would work. After leaving it again and playing with it I was able to finally get it to boot up and go through set up. The mouse that came with it didn’t work, so I replaced it with a spare I had on hand. Once everything was set up I started taking a look at the software that was pre-installed. The first desktop icon I clicked on took a full 15 seconds to do anything. Internet Explorer, my preferred browser, wasn’t installed. I ate a leisurely lunch while it downloaded. Yes, it took that long. And before anyone asks, there is nothing wrong with my internet. I logged on to my Edward Jones account, but I didn’t have the patience to wait FOUR MINUTES between screens. There is software installed on the machine that I wasn’t expecting, such as Microsoft Publisher, Excel, and some second-class programs for opening pdf files, etc. Oddly, no Adobe Acrobat Reader. The machine is obviously used, which I knew when purchasing, but it feels like the previous owner’s data files were wiped out but their programs left in place. It’s not worth the hassle to return the computer, so I’m going to start stripping out the unwanted programs, give it a thorough going over to make sure there are no unwanted “gifts” on there, and see if I can’t get the speed up to at least close to where it should be. But this should serve as a caution to other buyers that they’re probably not going to receive a machine likely to work satisfactorily out of the box.UPDATE - One day later and the keyboard has quit working.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI rec'd desktop today.  I was a little weary ordering bc I just returned one that I bought thru Amazon from another vendor bc I could not get the Wifi to work and it was utterly impossible to connect with the vendor for help.  This computer turned on and the Wifi started right away.  The speakers are quite low (they are on the highest volume) but I still would recommend for the price and the fact that it does work.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nGood value for the money as far as the monitor goes. i5 processor is kinda slow for today's web, so I kinda wish I went with something bigger. Still good value for the money. But the keyboard and mouse are horrible - they are branded United PC-Tech (same as merchant) and they aren't worth anything. On the keyboard is tall and the keys require lots of travel... and you must push the keys down all the way otherwise they won't react. It will drive you nuts if you are used to using a Surface or any laptop. The mouse... get this - it isn't level!! Who sells a mouse that isn't level!?? How do you even manufacture a non-level mouse? It wobbles back and forth like a chair with one leg too short. These components were obviously taken off of China's trash heap, the merchant probably got them free or for cents on the dollar because they are worth less than the bag and zip tie that came with them. All in all, value for the tower and monitor is good, but purchase a mouse and keyboard separate.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nThis computer package is used for two church committees.Although you can see some wear and tare on the monitor, it works perfectly well and I am happy with my purchase.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI really like this stand!  It suits my 15\" Macbook Pro perfectly.  Nice matching aluminum material.  Very solid.  Even with the clear shell I have on the Mac.  It keepa my mac safe above my bar surface.  Its almost worh getting as an insurance policy against spills.  I added a bluray drive and USB/card reader port to the underside... so it is more of a utility dock now.  Great setup!\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nNot only is this stand stylish (it seem like something Apple would make), but it is at a great height and incline for typing, and there is plenty of space underneath my laptop to store my external hard drive... the cat also likes to lay under there. :) I highly recommend this product.UPDATE (2-22-18): I'm still using and loving this stand, although the cat no longer fits under it so easily.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nThis is a fantastic option for any Mac laptop user. I work from home and revamped my Macbook Pro into what now feels like a desktop. I no longer have to hunch down to look at the screen-- giving me better posture and less back/neck stiffness. You can't tell from the picture, but the forward facing part (where the computer would press against) also includes more of the rubber padding that you can see on the flat part of the stand. So, don't worry about any scuffs happening to your pretty aluminum Macbook Pro or Air. The color also matches completely, so it looks like it was created by Apple as well. I'm a picky person, but I literally have no complaints!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nWhen the rubber bumpers on my stand fell off, I contacted Rain Design\\'s customer service about it. Their response was, \"unfortunately after time the pads do fall off\" and then suggested I pay $6 to buy additional bumpers from them. The mstand is a premium product, costing twice that of the Amazon brand laptop stand. If the manufacturer knows that the bumpers will fall off, they should fix the adhesive that they use instead of expecting customers to continually pay them for new bumpers.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI had same problem as many others giving this product one star--the rubber strips designed to hold the laptop in place come off after a short time.  I came home once to find my laptop had fallen off the stand and onto the floor because the grips don't stay in place. By the way, I live alone and have no cat or dog, so no it wasn't knocked off by another person or a pet.  Do not buy this product if you value your laptop!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI saw many of the reviews who had used this with a 15\" laptop, and wondered how well it would work with my 17\" MBP.  I don\\'t know anyone that owns one, so I was a little uncertain.  No worries - it works PERFECTLY!  See the image I loaded that shows it in use, along with a 22\" Gateway monitor, and a 24\" HP monitor that complete my workstation.The design leaves room underneath the unit, which is great for extra storage, or sliding a keyboard under (although it\\'s not quite high enough if you tried to type under it).  Solid construction that should last, quite simply, forever.  The unit positions the laptop\\'s screen to a height that works perfectly with my other external monitors.Interestingly enough, the packaging it came in even reminded me of how Apple would have packaged it.  It\\'s a wonderful product that fills an obvious need, and is one of those \"why didn\\'t I think of that\" items.  Simple design, beautiful, and very functional.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nFantastic product! I bought this for my home recording studio so that I could have my 15\" MacBook Pro behind my midi keyboard. This stand is a perfect match to my MacBook Pro and the quality is excellent. For me it was just the right height so that it clears my midi keyboard :)\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nBeware if you purchase a USED version of this stand. Arrived today but had a cheaper steel amazon brand stand inside the Rain design Mstand box. Someone was naughty on their return.... Very disappointed it wasn't picked up when it was restocked. This would've been my second Rain Design Brand stand since i was extremely happy with the first one i bought a few months ago. Would've rated it 5 stars if correct stand was inside. Hopefully this will now be figured out in returns so it doesn't happen to someone else.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAt first I was skeptical about the purchase, since it\\'s not necessarily cheap, and many would say a couple of old thick books would get the job done.I do a lot of video and photo editing which means I can spend 5+ hours a day on my laptop. I became cautious about the health impacts of doing this, certainly the damage it does to your posture and consequently how you walk afterwards.The mStand elevates the screen to a much better height for day to day viewing where you don\\'t have to bend your neck to look down at your screen. The screen is still slightly below eye level for myself (6\\'4\") however works completely fine.Yes, a couple of thick books will also raise your screen, however I\\'d much rather spend $40 on something that looks extremely elegant and is identical in design to my MacBook Pro. Furthermore I can stow my bluetooth keyboard under the stand.Build quality is 9/10, very well built, looks elegant however when you type on your laptop it is prone to slight bounce/flex which is understandable since they wanted to keep the weight as low as possible.I highly recommend this product, I even brought it with me abroad as I moved somewhere else.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis was a product I wasn’t originally sold on but after owning it for almost a year, and adding a wireless keyboard & mouse. I can’t imagine using my laptop (MacBook Pro 13inch) for extended periods without it.THE GOODThe mStand’s design is sleek and minimalist, this is why I chose it over similar products. The style I purchased doesn’t have the rotating swivel base. I didn’t want to accidently have it spinning whenever I repositioned the stand, and that functionality wasn’t that attractive to me but I may give it a try in the future.I’d recommend using the stand with a wired/wireless mouse & keyboard, as this will greatly enhance your experience.However, if you have to use the keyboard and trackpad while your laptop is on the stand, there’s very little bounce as you press down on the keyboard. The laptop feels secure and the stand doesn’t move around, I’m not sure if this is the same for the rotating swivel base version. Another thing, your arms do start to tire out if you continue using your laptop this way, at least they did for me.THE BADThe price is a bit on the high end. If you’re on a budget, you can purchase something like the AmazonBasics version for a lot less. Same functionality but it may look and feel cheaper. I went with the mStand because different sources gave it a high praise and I liked the design. Also, if you’re like me, and you’re planning on owning this stand for a long time, might as well get a high quality one. And this is definitely a high quality one.Even though the stand is padded to protect your laptop from scratches. If you’re not careful as you’re placing the laptop on the stand, there are some areas where metal on metal can definitely lead to a scratch. It hasn’t happened to me but it’s something to be aware of.THINGS TO NOTEI mainly used the stand while doing some Adobe Indesign work, R programming & data analysis, putting together slide decks, and general internet use.One last thing, a common sense sort of thing, how far you position the stand from you will impact the strain on your eyes. As a person who wears glasses, I have to have the stand a bit closer towards me so that I can still read and not be overly fatigued. But whenever I’m using it to watch videos, I’ll move the stand further back.It also does take up some space so make sure your desk has enough room for it. The area underneath the stand serves as a nifty storage space, I use it to put away my wireless keyboard.All in all, I’m super happy with this purchase. So much that I’ve bought it twice. And I’ll continue supporting this company for many years.Cheers!\\n',\n",

I didn't want to spend a great deal of money, especially with Windows 10, ad OS I strongly dislike. This package was very appealing: what it contained and the price. I've only had it a couple of days, but so far, so good. Everything in it works as should. Everything arrived as described and promptly. Packaged was well packaged, though, why it isn't marked fragile, I don't know. No assembly instructions were included, but it was very easy to install. I don't know about the quality of keyboard and mouse because I'm using my older one. Very easy to connect to WiFI. No issues have arisen yet. I hope this one lasts half as long as its predecessor. It's fast, too, though I don't know about gaming. It comes pre-installed with licensed Windows 10  Pro, which in comparison only has one feature not in Windows 10 home, so not worth much at all. I did some research online about this model. It's from 2011 and went for $1599.00 at that time with an overall score of 4.25 out of 5 stars in satisfaction. Of course, with full refurbishment here, it has been built up and upgraded. The package comes with a major brand monitor, but you don't know which one until you receive it. I received a Lenovo Thinkpad with mine. Overall, I think it is a good purchase at a great price.\\n\",\n",

I was hesitant to buy it at first when I saw how cheap it was, not knowing if in shipping it would get damaged, etc. but, it was completely covered in bubble wrap to protect everything! I know I haven't had it for long, but you can tell immediately that it is going to last.

My use-case is a little bit different from other people, but I can talk about some of the things that I've noticed using this so far.-Pros-1. The device comes with a legit copy of windows (mine had Windows 10 home). The box says 8 pro, but the inside says Windows 10. They probably updated the machine after it was made.2. The device makes zero noise and the unit itself doesn't seem to get that hot even with a ton of stuff open.3. Tons of ports: micro usb, usb 2.0, usb 1.0, sd card reader, ethernet, and hdmi.4. Very light. I can throw this in the bag and it doesn't add a lot of space or weight to my bag.5. Decent processor, which seems to be able to handle video streaming fine, although you'll probably need to use a wired connection for higher playback quality.6. Reliable Bluetooth connection7. Great performance with the gpu for retro gamesCons1. Wifi is a little dated, so you won't be able to connect to 5.0ghz signals. You're better off connecting this to lan which is what I ended up doing.2. Small storage: you'll be left with 15gb after you finish setup. This wasn't a problem for me because my roms are on a micro sd card, but I wanted to mention it here.\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nFirst off, this isn't a gaming computer. If you expect this to act like an 800 dollar PC, you're going to be disappointed.That being said, it works extremely well for what it is.I had no issues out of the box aside from it being a tad slow. Once all of the updates were downloaded and applied and Windows was cleaned of its initial bloat, the system saw a significant speed increase. It performs well with web browsing and general operating system tasks and doesn't delay much when opening programs or asking Windows to perform tasks.It does only have 32GB of hard drive space, so you'll need to make sure you clean up the disk space after all of the Windows Updates (Windows is notorious for not cleaning up after itself). I also went through and disabled some of the un-needed services to free up resources.Even with the system getting hammered with installing updates and such, the little box remains relatively cool (it's still warm, but nothing outrageous).I had no issues playing 1080p mkv files or mp4 files as well as 1080p content from Twitch and Youtube. 4K video was hit or miss, so I'm not quite sure it's powerful enough for 4K.All in all, it's a nice little machine and it will suit my need perfectly as a little computer to hook to my projector as a portable movie computer.\\n\",\n",

And most of the hotels around are now equipped with HDTV that has hdmi input, so you can hook it up easily with your travel.* of course Windows friendly.  It is installed with windows 10 home.  The version I found out on mine is 1709.  So the familiar windows apps can still be run on this mini pc.* adequate and power enough for most use.  Streaming and watch videos I found no problem.  Office applications are ok.  Internet browsing is also fast enough and responsive.  Of course dont expect you can open 20 tabs.  I'm surprised with its performance even it has only 2gb ram.* usb 3.0 port.  I am happy it comes with built in wifi and a usb 3.0 port.  The internal flash storage is ok, not fast like the ssd nor harddrive.  So the usb 3.0 port comes in handy to expand storage and maybe it can used to connect some drives and use this mini pc to server as mini file server.Box runs little warm but not hot.  Satisfied with this mini windows box overall.  Price is ok for me while it's still under 100 and have windows installed.  It is activated with no problem.\\n\",\n",

Everything was just excellently fine except the battery management daemon. The power level kept on decreasing continuously although there is no battery inside. Initially, I suspect it was Ubuntu bug. But after a few hours of Google search, I decided it could be hardware wiring problem. Hardware wiring of power supply may trigger Ubuntu to think it was battery instead of a power supply. Therefore, I had made the following changes to the following file:\"/etc/UPower/UPower.conf\".....NoPollBatteries=true.....PercentageLow=-100000PercentageCritical=-30000PercentageAction=-20000.......Then reboot my machine. Fortunately, the machine didn\\'t send battery updates to UPower of Ubuntu 18.10. The battery level stopped at 60.0% finally. Thanks God that I fixed it.

The box containing the monitor/cords/keyboard was sealed with packaging tape that appeared to have been reused, as it would hardly stick to the box.I unpacked everything and connected the components according to the single sheet of instructions that was included. I turned on the monitor and pressed the power button on the PC. Immediately, a red light on the front of the PC began flashing and a repeating series of 3 beeps began to sound. Not good. Nothing appeared on the monitor. The button to open the DVD drive tray also did not work.In short, the PC did not work. At all.Upon reviewing the included information sheet, it stated that no exchanges or returns would be done without contacting their technical support. I went to the website listed, only to find the support section “under maintenance”.So I’m currently trying to return this item through Amazon. I fully expect my request for return to either be denied or not replied to at all, in which case I’ll file a claim.I didn’t expect much of a computer for $133.

       " '\\nGot the 14 inch, model 81C90009US and been using since end Jan 2018.  This is a super high value laptop, in that you get a ton of capability and expandability for your money while being able to run all the latest generations of hardware: 8th gen Intel i5 with 4 DISCREET cores plus hyperthreading, DDR 4 RAM, and PCIe M.2 SSD.  Did tons of research, bought and returned two other models before settling on the Flex5.My situation is that I recently retired so had to give up my work laptops and get something personal.  Have been a table PC user since 2004, so tablet PC form factor and functionality were a requirement.  While I could afford a pretty wide range of laptops, other requirements guided me to the Flex 5, specifically, touch screen, good active digitizer, the 14\" size, and the PCIe M.2 + 2.5\"SSD storage options all combined with an 8th gen Intel processor.  This COMBINATION of features and FLEXIBILITY is very hard to find, Lenovo really nailed it with the Flex5 at an outstanding price!Quick list of the Positives and Negatives, then more details and benchmarks below...Positives:+Tablet PC form factor (standard laptop, tent, tablet with touch and pen) with far above average performance and upgrade flexibility for the price.+Both PCIe M.2 and SATA SSD slots mean you can put a ton of very fast storage in this relatively compact machine.+8th gen Intel Core i5-8250U provides 8 total threads of processing on 4 physical cores plus hyperthreading, a very low base clock of 1.6 GHz for power saving, a 3.4 GHz Turbo for power when needed, and a nice low 15w total power dissipation for both battery life and running cool.  My experience is that some generations of Intel procs are smaller steps, some bigger, and the 8th gen is one of the bigger steps in speed and efficiency.+Great battery life, I regularly get 5-6 hours, more than enough for my usage style, and very good overall for all the power on tap, display size, etc.+14\" screen is the optimum size for me personally.  I\\'ve owned everything from 10\"-17\" laptops, and 14\" is the sweet spot for me.  This screen is HD resolution of 1920x1080, which is fine for my use on the road or away from the desk.  I\\'ve had a QHD external monitor, and that is fun, and where I\\'d put my money if I needed more resolution.  I dock and have three HD screens, though, so that\\'s enough for me.+Touch is extremely reliable and configurable.  Digitizer for the pen is Wacom, so it is OUTSTANDING for note taking, a key requirement for me.  The Lenovo Active Pen that comes with this config of the Flex5 is actually very good.  I\\'ve got a drawer with about 30 different active and passive styli I\\'ve used over the years, and this is one of the better ones.  It\\'s also a good value at twenty six bucks.  I bought three extras, one for each of my travel cases plus the one in the holder that slides into the usb port on the Flex.\\xa0Lenovo Active Capacity Pens for Touchscreen Laptop for Lenovo  Yoga 720, Flex 5, Miix 720, Miix 510 and Yoga 900s Laptops - GX80K32882.+Just enough ports.  With three USB3 on hand, two type A and one type C, I can do most of what I want and need directly connecting to the laptop when away from the desk.  See docking details under Connections, below.  The HDMI port is FULL SIZE, thank goodness, simplifying connections on the road, and the SDXC slot is also full size, meaning easier connections to all  that SDXC storage I have from multiple generations of cameras, etc.+802.11AC wifi built in.  My home is all multi channel AC, so this is nice from a speed stand point.+Expandable RAM.  I replaced the 8GB stick with 16GB Crucial\\xa0Crucial ME CT16G4SFD8266 16G DDR4 2666MT s CL19 DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM Retail, provides a nice bit of RAM headroom when using demanding programs or many programs.+Finger print reader is fast, reliable, and works extremely well with Windows 10.+Backlit keyboard is a real boon in low/no light.Negatives-The screen is just barely bright enough to use in a sunlit room, and washes out when outdoors in sunlight.  I have a sun room where I use the Flex5 sometimes, and have to max the brightness and be sure I don\\'t have direct sunlight on the screen to get a good viewing experience.  It\\'s ok overall, but I would have liked a little more headroom on the screen brightness for these sunny occasions.  Indoors normal lighting is no issue.-The power connector is 4.0x1.7mm barrel connector, different than the other THREE Lenovo/ThinkPad connectors I\\'ve used previously, so a bit of adapting was in order to use the 19v and 20v laptop powerbricks I already owned.  Worked out, see details below under Connections.-The SDXC card slot only takes in about half of the card length, meaning no leaving a card in the slot all the time.Combined, these three negatives were not worth a whole star given the strong and almost unique combination of positives, so 5 stars from me.  Highly recommended stock for the price, and as a platform to build out a high storage laptop with very good performance across the board.DETAILS:*********Storage: 5TB total as I configured it.*********I have a TON of stuff I like to keep on my laptop, and needed over 2TB capacity.  Since PCIe M.2 maxes out at 2TB right now, and those 2TB PCIe drives are very expensive per GB, that meant I needed something with two storage options, OR just a 2.5\" SSD option (I already owned a 4 TB Samsung 2.5 SSD and wanted to use it\\xa0Samsung 850 EVO 4TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E4T0B/AM)) .With the Flex5, I decided I go with a good fast 1TB PCIe M.2 SSD as the boot drive, the\\xa0Samsung 960 EVO Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6E1T0BW), and then use my 4TB 2.5\" SSD as the data drive.  I imaged the included 128GB M.2 SSD to the new 1TB M.2 BEFORE I even turned on the laptop for the first time using Acronis and my desktop PC, that way, no concerns about drive Id\\'s etc.  Worked like a charm.*********Connections*********Connections on the laptop are: Power - 4.0x1.7mm barrel barrel connector for 20v power supply, 1 full size HDMI out, 1 3.5mm stereo jack for speakers. USB is 2x USB 3 type A, one type C. For a docking station I\\'m using the\\xa0Plugable USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station for Windows (Dual Video HDMI & DVI / VGA, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio, 6 USB Ports). Have this connected to the USB C port. Have a monitor connected to the Dock via HDMI, and another to the HDMI out on the Flex5, for a total of 3 monitors including the Flex5 screen when docked. I run my audio out of the dock as well for convenience, vs. having another wire to connect to the laptop. The size of the power input is different than the other THREE Lenovo types I\\'ve owned and used before, so I just bought a bunch of 5.5x2.1mm to 4.0x1.7mm barrel adapters\\xa0DC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall ChargersDC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall Chargersand used some of the many 19v and 20v chargers I had laying around.

       " \"\\nI've been pleasantly surprised by how much I like this laptop.  I've been using it for a month, and really enjoy its features.PROS1) My first touch screen laptop.  I am surprised how much I use the screen.  It is faster than a mouse, although I still use both.  It's great.2) Fingerprint reader - I love how quick I can unlock my computer using the fingerprint reader.  Also, it works with my password manager, Dashlane.  Saves time.3) Tent and tablet mode - I wasn't sure that I'd ever use these modes, but it turns out to be handy.  In tablet mode, I found it very convenient during Amazon's Prime Day sales.  It has a larger screen than most tablets, and perfect for the Prime Day sales.  I use tent mode to watch movies a little closer.  The speakers are positioned in such a way that I can hear things clearly whichever way it is set up.4) Pen - Well, I'm not yet fully sold on the usefulness of the pen.  Maybe if I liked taking notes by hand or drawing more.  Still, it's a nice feature to have.5) Solid State Drive - now whirling parts on the inside, and it is cooler to run.6) Fast, at least so far after one month of heavy use.  I'm avoiding downloading too many programs though.7) Speakers are louder and better quality than any of my previous laptops.CONS1) Two normal USB ports, and one USB C port.  Since most of my components use regular USB, I had to buy a special adapter to use the USB C port.  Still, three ports isn't enough, and the Lenovo pen holder uses one of the ports for stowing.2) Small Hard Drive - with only about 250 GBs of drive space, I can no longer store the amount of photos, movies, etc. that I did on my last computer.  No matter, I have a few external drives with several terabytes, but I wish my laptop had more space.3) No DVD drive - But like my hard drive, I have an external DVD drive that I got for around $20.In short, I really like this laptop and would probably buy a Lenovo again when this one eventually goes kaput.  Hopefully not for many years.\\n\",\n",

I do use the laptop outside, so it is usable, there are just times when the reflection is too apparent, and interferes with seeing the screen.It looks very sleek and feels very solid. When I sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap (go figure), the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably.

The only things I would comment to the downside on are these. It was not exactly clear if the package included wif adapter, not say one way or the other was confusing, so when the unit arrived, I had go out and buy one. Another was that, although it comes loaded with Windows 10 Pro which is great, the next week was spent enduring frequent slow periods over the wifi not know why. Later, it became appartent that the version of Windows which came in the package needed considerable updating, which Microsoft supplied at no cost. But the way Microsoft did it was by opening sockets, in the background thereby sucking up bandwidth, without specifically providing notifications. Consequently, this causes me to spend a number of days troubleshooting with the vendor of my newly installed wifi adapter to see if that was causing the issue, and time with my ISP for the same reason. The issue finally became apparent when my son fired up his notebook and an none of the problems I was having, which meant it was not a speed issue with my wifi adapter, nor ISP. So that left my new computer which I was was about to contact the vendor about and return if necessary. But fortunately, as I have said the coz became apparent and since then no issues at all. IMHO, this could all have been avoided by including a more updated version of Windows 10 in the package. That way all or most of the time updating would have been done before I received the package. I wouldn't call these issues showstoppers and would and have recommended this package to anyone.\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nCards on the table -- We are not power users or a gamers. We use the computer for web surfing, writing, and watching videos, and there's someone using the computer pretty much all day long. For the past several years, we've been using a variety of laptops and haven't used a desktop since they used clunky CPUs and boxy monitors and a boatload of cables. I am very impressed with the HP Pavilion desktop. The guts are all in the back of the monitor, which at 23.8 inches is huge. The included wireless keyboard and mouse are super simple to connect and require AAA batteries, included. That's it for hardware. The computer was a snap to set up, the most time consuming bit was importing my bookmarks to the browser, which if I had uploaded to the cloud in the first place, would have taken less time. Windows 10 is pre-loaded. The monitor is impressively sharp and it's a touch screen. I like the fact that the camera is in a separate slide-up attachment on the back of the screen, so when you aren't using it, it's completely hidden. I was a little doubtful about switching to a desktop after downsizing to a laptop, but this desktop takes up only a little more room and it's only because the monitor is bigger, which is turning out to be a real benefit, much easier to see the detail on maps, charts, photos, newspapers, etc. Writing is also easier with the keyboard detached -- you can put it where its more comfortable and angle the monitor and the keyboard separately if you like. I can't think of anything I don't like about the computer after using it for a couple of weeks. It's great!Update 6/30/19The computer developed a hardware fault about a month ago, which means it was still a pretty new computer. When I powered on the computer, the screen remained black and the speaker emitted a series of loud beeps. When I figured the beeps were a code, I looked it up and found that the problem was a hardware flaw that required a solution more complex than I could manage. I've had problems with computers before so have managed to fix my own computer when the problem is software or a memory problem. But this was beyond me and not worth fixing so I managed to wipe the computer (I hope) and recycled it. I don't need such serious problems with a new computer!\\n\",\n",

Well the outcome was the motherboard was toast and needed to be replaced .So I had him replace the board for 119.00 Mat and Labor and then have him replace the hard drive With 500 gb SSD and he did it all for 199.00 it worked fine and very quick after that. So I ordered 16 gigs of ram from Amazon installed them and the unit screams now . The vid card is very poor and if you plan to use it for games you wont especially 3 D . So if you get one delivered and it works out of the box ,I think you will have a decent run of the mill desk top nothing special. I did call the tech support from where it was sent and they were overrun with calls. Wanted you to leave a # to be reached at and said they would get back to you .That was on a Friday they said they would get back no later than the following Mon. So so far I have invested 238.00 for unit 199.00 for motherboard 60 bucks on 16 G ram  Total of 20 G on unit now after I upgrade the vid card it will be great for gaming for the grand kids. good luck.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAmazing.  Love it.  Good price.  Can play Sims.  Two monitors one Tower keyboard and a mouse and wireless.  Easy setup up.  Mega awesome  for the price.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nWe weren't sure what to expect for the price but we did not get the wifi adapter the seller said it came with. It was a Christmas gift so we purchased one right away hoping the seller would refund us. The seller never got back to is about this issue. We bought this PC for my son to game. It initially ran train sim but would not run fortnite. We had to purchase a new graphics card. It's hard for me to complain because even tho we had to spend a additional $100+ it still isn't a bad price. My review is poor because it did not hold up to the advertised product and the seller hasn't had good communication let alone assistance. It's worth the cost however, it was a Christmas gift for the purpose to play fortnite. It was very disappointing and frustrating that he couldn't play straight away. We ran out and bought the wifi adapter the next day but it took a little while to get the grafic card shipped to us. It was easy enough to install after watching how to YouTube videos.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIf I were to buy again, I'd get a bundle with better monitors. They work - a little outdated. Computer is fast, can't complain there....monitors, eh. For the money: 4 stars.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nLove, love, love my new computer! Shipped right away and got it in two days! Packaged very well. Came with two matching, good quality Samsung monitors. The keyboard and mouse are low quality, but they were brand new and work great. Easy to set up right out of the box. WiFi adapter is not the best, and my computer is far from the router, so I'll buy a better one sometime. I use the computer for Quickbooks Online, Excel spreadsheets, and home computing. Great bang for your buck!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nReceived in nicely packed box.  Both monitors are the same.  They had to send me a new wifi adapter cause the one that came with it did not work.  Now that i have receieved the wifi adapter, which works,  i am getting the blue screen of death.  Emailed customer,service so we shall see.  So far not too impressed\\n',\n",
       " '\\nfor the price/ no complaints at all.  Love the computer\\n',\n",
       " '\\ntook me a while, but thanks to OUTSTANDING tech support, I got it up and running and it performs great. The staff at Blair Technology were patient and walked me through what needed to be done.  Thanks, Blair Technology.\\n']"
