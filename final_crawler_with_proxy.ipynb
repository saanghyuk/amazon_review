Got this home and set up in under an hour, The settings are pretty extensive and allows for a lot of tweeking. Normal reception (from Comcast cable) is extremely limited by 1080P and picture is not as sharp as it could be. Since we don't subscribe to streaming services that provide 4K, can't really comment on extended viewing of 4K content. Vizio does have a short 4K video that can be downloaded to a thumb drive and plugged into the USB port.  The picture from the video is outstanding. It is crisp, clear and sharp. The sound is a little low, but a sound bar alleviates this issue. After trying LG, Hisense and another Vizio (developed a vertical line after 4 days), we went with this Vizio model and are pretty pleased so far. Plus, Costco gives you and extra year of warranty at no cost. I would recommend this TV.\\n  \\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I purchased a unit from Best Buy a few days ago and had to return it because there was a large amount of backlight bleed. Since this is a brand new model (V505-G9) I was hoping it was just a bad panel...and I was correct, as the replacement looks excellent. For $299, this TV is fantastic. Dolby Vision from the Apple TV 4k looks great (even better than HDR10 from my Roku Ultra) and the TV is very responsive. The blacks are very deep, the whites are very white, the colors absolutely pop (used rtings.com calibration settings for the 2018 E/D series), and the picture in 4K is crystal clear (1080p looks good too). Overall a great unit for the price. Could you get a better picture from a P-Series? Probably, but this is less than half the cost and that is hard to beat.\\n  \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Bought this at Walmart for $299.By far the best tv I’ve ever owned.When watching shows or movies in HD and HDR the picture looks like real life, it’s amazing. You will see details that you’ve neverseen before when using a non 4K tv, so crisp and clean.The Tv comes with built in live streaming tv for free, Pluto tv, and also Xumo, and it’s a great addition! Pluto has a ton of non premium channels that anyone can enjoy( no fox, cbs, nbc, amc and stuff). I personally love River Monsters 24/7 Channel, Gordon Ramsey Channel, Forensic Files Channel. There’s a ton of channels. Entertainment, sports, news, cooking, gaming, animals, anime, music, movies. Something for everyone.Xumo has more premium channels, History Channel, NBC news, Today News, CBSN, Fox Sports, PGA tour.Between the two apps you’re getting well over 300 live channels.Also since it’s a smart tv there’s plenty of apps built in like Netflix, Hulu, Prime, YouTube, iHeartRadio, Vudu, etc. Also built in is Chromecast so you can watch any other apps installed on your phone and stream them to the TV. This feature worked flawlessly the few times I used it.The TV also supports Alexa/google home use. I just received a dot for Xmas and it is very nice giving out demands and having the tv respond! You can have the tv turn on/off, volume up/down, open apps, or go to specific channels.-Note, I’ve noticed the built in streaming apps don’t stream in high resolution for some reason, they usually stream in 720p and 480p. I bought the 4K fire stick and the same show would stream in 1080p on the stick but only 720p in the built in app. I’ve looked through the settings and can’t find anything.Only negative to the tv would be the sound. It’s pretty bad. Just low and lifeless. It says it has built in surround sound but even when that’s activated it sounds bad. I have a sound bar so it’s not much of an issue for me, but I’d definitely recommend anyone who buys this tv to get one.Overall it’s just an incredible TV and well worth the price. Picture is great, and the addition of live TV is very nice for people like me who do not have cable.\\n  \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    When viewing the screen from 45 degrees or more, the picture seems to be washed out and loses color.  But other than that, I love it so far.\\n  \\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Just buy it already.It's a great value good tech fast free delivery. What else you need?. Nothn. Watch for delivery ..  TV got delivered to the wrong address.\\n  \\n\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Very good product.\\n  \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    For gaming. Its working great very pleased.  Thank you Amazon.\\n  \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Nice size just need to sit and read the tv in order to use it\\n  \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This smart TV has a great picture! Wonderful for watching everything from local satellite channels to Amazon Prime videos. Use it a lot to watch Youtube videos.\\n  \\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    i went to settings to adjust  display no more wash out ,it wasn't washed out very bad. picture is great. so many adjustment you can use to fit the way you want it to look. i got the sound bar WHAT A GREAT DEAL ,HDMI,SMART AND SOME.i give this TV a 5 star worth the price and got it in three day's No damage. DAM GOOD DEAL I would recommend it.\\n  \\n\"]\n",
