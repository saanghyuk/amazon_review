0	tv	"Item weight of 3.9lbs in the ""technical description"" is **highly inaccurate**. Im so happy I bought this laptop despite this 3.9lbs inaccuracy, as this laptop is extremely lightweight and portable - probably under 2lbs. As another reviewer said $1300+ laptops are often crapshoots --- my mid2012 Macbook Pro gave me constant headaches since 6months after purchase-- problems that even Applecare Warranty couldn't fix and Applecare refused to replace it so essentially i wasted $1500 on my easily overheated Macbook Pro and never wanted to waste $1500 on a basic laptop again (next expensive laptop will be Razer Blade or Gigabyte AERO). This time around, I needed a basic laptop for trading software programs that take up a lot of memory, so I bought 2 of these and will probably buy 1 more as I need to run 6 programs total so Ill split 2 programs on each. My experience: nicely packaged, arrived with a full battery, setup in under 5 minutes, it recognized all nearby wifi options (and a lot of cheap laptops don't recognize wifi signals) , i downloaded the software that I needed in a few minutes. Everything set up fast and seamlessly. Trackpad super easy to use. It sometimes briefly/momentarily lags when I type but i also type 90wpm .... I bought the $50 two year Asurion insurance just in case it turns out to be a lemon in 6month+ . For $270 , with insurance, i can buy 3 and be happy using these for specific, niche purposes or as reliable backups. Ive tried other cheap laptops and this has the User Experience of an expensive Apple laptop (im much happier with 3 of these than 1 2019 Macbook Air like my sister just bought). Only real CON is it could be brighter (it definitely has lower brightness than both Macbook Pro and Macbook Air). I will be running the software this upcoming week Monday-Friday for 8hours/day-- so unless when I actually run the software it freezes, crashes, or overheats excessively -- I'll remain a happy camper. Will keep the actual functionality updated in the comments.  But so far, thanks JUMPER!!! Please, fix your 3.9lbs description (which might scare buyers off like it almost scared me off) because for the price, size, *specs* (6gb ram), and weight this laptop rocks!"
1	tv	I compared this machine with several offerings. The major brands (HP, Lenovo, Dell etc.) were too expensive. The less expensive machines often had poor reviews or looked cheap (plastic cases, small screens etc.). I bought the JUMPER Ebook X3 mainly because it was very affordable, has a decent sized 13.3” screen and the performance specs look OK. However, a big plus was the solid metal case. This something that is standard on Macbooks, but they come in at $800 upwards! Hopefully, this means that the JUMPER will be much more robust than the tacky plastic machines offered by others.I needed a laptop that was light, portable and would let me access emails and surf the net. However, I also need to do some work and the coupling with Microsoft 365 was a big plus or me.Out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised. This machine has the look and feel of something that should cost more than it did. I powered it up and after basic set up, it ran perfectly first time. I had been a little concerned because a couple of reviews mentioned initial difficulties and replacements. However, I guess at this price there could be a few duds, but as long as the supplier is responsive (which the reviews said they were), then this is a small risk worth taking in my view.The screen quality is excellent displays my photos is high quality. I also like the full-sized keyboard and the trackpad works just fine. The Wi-Fi connected up to my router with no issues.As a Windows 10 machine, there is excellent compatibility with loads of software, and I would expect to encounter no issues. The spec for the EBOOK X3 is perhaps too light for a serious gamer, due to the processor speed and RAM required. In my hands, it is perfect for email, internet, social media and straightforward Office use. It is also surprisingly quick – this might because it has a solid state drive rather than a slower (and more battery draining) conventional hard drive. Although it comes with only 64Gb of storage spaceOverall, first impressions of the Jumper are very favour
2	tv	"Was not expecting much from this when purchased, but I gotta say it works REALLY well. Without all the bells and whistles of useless programs and features most people will never use, this is PERFECT for a student or even your elderly parents. Simple and easy to use and lighter and more compact than an Apple of the same size.I did install Firefox because I really don't like Microsoft; AND I DID NOT WANT TO PAY $600 plus FOR AN APPLE...and it runs way better than the installed Microsoft Edge version of Explorer. Able to have 10 tabs open, doing various things and performance was not compromised. Whether keeping up with your social media to Streaming video full HD video, this laptop SHINES!!! The display is simply beautiful.While it doesn't have a ton of hard drive space, that's what external drives are for. I have been storing ALL of my files on one since I had a massive HD fail on me about 15 years ago.  And if you need word processing there are many great FREE programs you can use. And the battery life is BETTER than my daughter's Apple!!!YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PERFORMANCE & EASE OF USE FOR THE MONEY!!! So stop thinking and click that ""BUY NOW"" button!"
3	tv	This is a really good computer for the price. Don't let the chinese/japanese characters scare you. It boots up pretty fast, maybe 10 seconds at most. It's made out of aluminum and feels sturdy while staying light. The bottom heats up but wouldn't burn your legs, maybe sweat. There's some bloatware but it's easy to uninstall. One of the things I don't like is the coloring, the WHOLE computer is the same material and color except for the trackpad (which is also nice). The fact that its 6gb of ram and 64gb of memory should make you buy it considering the price. It lags sometimes, but its bearable, you won't have programs crashing though. I'm using this mostly for watching youtube and school, so it works for that. I haven't played any games with it but I wouldn't recommend it because there's only 64 gb and the processor isn't the strongest. 4.5/5
4	tv	Got this laptop because mines broke and didn’t really want to spend the money for a new one..So I went the cheaper route..I’ve never heard of the brand so I was a little nervous about buying it, but took the chance anyway..So far so good.. it moves faster than my last laptop which was an HP.. it’s supper light weight, hold an battery for an extremely long time
5	tv	"It is a pleasure to buy an inexpensive item and find that it is a quality unit.I purchased this basically as an MP3 jukebox. I needed Windows to work with my DAC, and I find that Windows Media Player(which I think they are discontinuing) to be the best music player app. I also prefer Windows to Android and Apple IOS. It is very easy, convenient and relatively fast to copy 10,000 MP3's from my home computer to an SD card to install in this unit.When I first started the Jumper, it required numerous Windows updates as you would expect. They finished in an acceptable time without any problems.I had to mess with the DAC, the problem was solved with a new USB cable. After that, it worked flawlessly. The music sounds fantastic and I have my MP3 collection available for me wherever I go.I also tested streaming Netflix and it did it easily.It is a snappy little unit, costs about the same as an off brand 10"" tablet. I will also use it for travel, because if it gets ripped off, it is not much of a loss. Certainly less than my iPad."
6	tv	Bought this laptop for movies only . But I found it running fast. It’s full HD screen . The battery can running long times . The sound is good. Value for this low price. I recommend to many friends .
7	tv	It is smaller than I usually get, but the screen is so clear that I have no problem seeing the screen. It is really a great computer at a great price. I'm really glad that I decided to take a chance on it.  I absolutely love it.
8	tv	At first I was skeptical about buying a laptop online, but my friend bought one online and it turned out pretty well so I decided to follow suit. The 1 GHZ of storage is really nice, more than my previous laptop. The screen is pretty fluent, HD screen doesn’t disappoint at all. It’s not pixelated at all, and the settings were really easy to set up. The speakers are also very solid, exceeded beyond that my skeptical expectations, not to mention it is way faster than my previous laptop. All my worries went out the window when I received this, and I love it!
9	tv	This Jumper laptop is far better than it's price would lead one to believe.  The build quality is excellent.  It's functionality is excellent if used as it is intended.  This is designed to be a high quality, basic Windows 10 laptop.  It does every thing I wanted it for as I only need or want to use Windows for a few operations.  I'm not a big fan of Windows.  I prefer Chrome, Linux and Android.  I replaced a similar priced unit that lasted 15 months and then gave up the ghost.  I haven't found any negative features to mention.
10	tv	I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!
11	tv	"A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as ""basic needs"" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to ""S Mode"" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"
12	tv	A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.
13	tv	This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.
14	tv	The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .
15	tv	"I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and ""safe."" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."
16	tv	It runs amazing
17	tv	"This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5"" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen."
18	tv	BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.
19	tv	"Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5"" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5"" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for ""2.5"" 500GB"" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of ""S"" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use."
20	tv	"Bought this unit as a budget replacement for my fairly high-powered Dell desktop which was lost during flooding. I wasn't expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected.Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box.I wasn't paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs.Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer.Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that's just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it.Pretty sure I'm going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won't do complex graphics.Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I've read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life.Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon.The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don't even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions.A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that ""it gets so hot"" or ""the fan sounds like a 747 taking off"": Just because it's called a laptop doesn't mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable.If it died tomorrow, I'd buy another.Loving itUpdate 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close):""Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!""Did you hear that? I'm a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I'll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I'm OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer.Totally pleased."
21	tv	"The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you're going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the ""acer quick access application"" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port.Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can't even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I'll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you're a long time acer product user and you've become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality. I cannot overemphasize how much you should AVOID buying this laptop. You are going to HATE IT!"
22	tv	I spent hours looking for a nice and affordable laptop and this Acer Aspire is what I landed on.Things that were important to me:- Price ( Around $500)- Speed (i5 or better)  * The new Intel i5 processors can turbo boost from 1.6ghz up to 3.9ghz without overheating. This computer is fast!!- Backlite Keyboard- Screen Size 15.6in or greater- Memory- Thin and light- AluminumMet all my expectations and moreThe only con, and this is being nit picky, is that the fan vent is located under the laptop. If I have the laptop sitting on my lap for awhile and I start to hear the fan working hard, I try to prop up so the vent can breath.Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase.
23	tv	I bough this Acer a few days ago to replace a Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 that suddenly died (monitor stopped working) 3 short years after buying it. I was originally reluctant to buy an Acer as I was not very sure about the quality, was concerned about another review that mentioned the fan was very loud, and was not sure I could live with a SSD of 256 only. Here are my initial impressions:1 Speed. It is a JOY to power up this computer. In fact, I shut it down and then back up just to enjoy how fast it is to power up. I was always amazed by how the Chromebook my son gets from his middle school was so much faster than my Satellite (or even the HP I have at work) was to power up. I guess it all pretty much boiled down to the SSD vs. the HDD hard drive. If you are debating whether it makes a difference, I can grantee you it makes a world of difference. This computer is up and running in seconds. I used to DREAD doing anything in my 3 year old Satellite. No more. It is also very fast to write to the SSD if you are downloading large files. Fast fast fast.2 Storage. I have a ton of pictures and videos and they won't all fit in this 256GB SSD, but is it VERY easy to solve that. This computer comes with an HDD harness and cable to add an internal HDD (max width is 7mm) and there are Acer videos on  how to do it. I almost did it in about 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful only because I tried to use the 1TB HDD from my Satellite not realizing the width was 9.5mm until I tried to close the case back up. You can buy a compatible 1TB HDD for about $50. You can also add an external HDD of 2TB in capacity for about $60. With either of these solutions you get a really fast computer with enough storage.3 Current Generation Processor (Intel Core 5 8th generation). You can check the benchmarks on how fast it is. For my General Family Laptop purposes it fits the bill just fine.4 Build quality. This laptop feels very sold and I love the lighten keys that the Satellite did not have.5 Really good overall value. I paid about $500 for this laptop, and if you factor an extra $50 to $60 for extra storage you are at a sub $600 setup with newest (as of July 2019) Intel Core 5, 256GB SSD, great build quality, good monitor, etc. I think it is a great deal.I have not tested this for video games or anything like that but for an overall home laptop it is great.
24	tv	This is a budget laptop that doesn't have a budget feel.  Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience.Specs:256GB SSD (excellent)3.9Ghz i5 (you can do better, but might have to go up in price range)8GB DDR4 RAM (not bad, you can do better)Windows 10 (excellent, albeit with ads)4 total USB Ports (Excellent)The computer is fast on startup, no doubt because of the SSD and the good i5 chipset that comes with this model.  When multiple apps are running, it can experience slowdown, but typically this has only happened with me while I'm running very intense programs - playing or converting media while surfing the web and typing something.  Again, this is something that I doubt most users of the device will notice, but if you are a power user, it makes sense to upgrade from this model.The other thing to call out is the speakers - they are outstanding.  Loud, clear sound, and easy controls make this a standout feature that most laptops don't have.The only major downside for me is that there is only the 256GB SSD, without any traditional hard drive for data storage.  It's not that there are not options, from cloud storage to removable drives, but it is kind of an inconvenience for those who have large data libraries they'd like to access on the go.  The device does come with a kit to upgrade the drive kit, but few users, myself included, will likely crack this open and give it a go.Overall, this is a classy piece of equipment that belies it's low price, and that makes it a great buy in my opinion.  You wouldn't think from taking a look at the construction or the general performance that this is a budget priced laptop.  It won't be for PC gamers, although a few older games will run fine on the device, and power users will notice occasional slowdowns, but you'd likely know that as soon as you see that this model is on the low end of the ACER spectrum.  Great performer.
25	tv	Great 1080p display that separates it from some other laptops. Not the most vivid colors, but definitely above average.I bought because my 10 year old previous laptop was finally starting to die and not be able to run programs. I'm getting into photo editing, so having something that runs Lightroom/Photoshop smoothly for editing was a must.Runs very quickly with the latest i5 processor, and the SSD means boot up takes seconds. The 8GB RAM should be great for most people unless you typically run tons of programs at once.Fingerprint sensor works every time, and the backlit keyboard is a nice touch.Love the aluminum shell and the lighter than average feel.The fan does pop on randomly sometimes and can be a touch on the loud side, but usually pops right back off unless you're doing something very intensive.Seriously, no real complaints at all. If your budget is 500 dollars and you're not using the laptop for gaming, this is one of the best options out right now. Don't hesitate.
26	tv	I like it, it's very fast and perfect for what I use it for.A purchaser complained about the function keys and their keyboard location, I don't use them a lot and it was not a problem for me.My fan makes no noise in normal everyday use and very little when large blocks of data are transferred.  For complaints about the charger not having a Acer label, many of the parts used by computer manufactures are made by other companies.I got a great computer without spending several hundred dollars.
27	tv	Coming from a 10 years old Celeron, I think that anything would be great to me. I use it mainly for office, reference manager (Zotero) and some browsing.Pros:It's a fast enough computer.No heating issues so far.Haven't checked the battery yet.Keyboard and touchpad are great.Can't tell on the screen cuz of my sore eyes.Cons:F buttons need to be reassigned through bios if you are used to using them (not a big deal)No indication for caps / num lock (there is a free app online for that if you really need it)Page up/down are shared with 3 and 9 in the num pad which makes my life difficult (I'd rather have smaller left/right keys and have dedicated keys for pg up/down)Home and End buttons are shared too (on 7 and 1 respectively)The fan occasionally becomes TOO noisy (at first I thought it was a malfunction of the laptop)Comes with Norton (for God's sake!!!)For non English speaking users, there are only english letters on the keyboard and you need to get used to it
28	tv	Pros:-Screen is bright and colors are good (in the product I got, I saw some people complaining about this so they might not have the best quality control)-The screen quality + size combination allows me to keep multiple windows open without feeling cramped or squinting-Battery lasts for advertised time (it's only about 7 hours with ~10 tabs and a VM running, but that's great imo)-The thing is light for its size/price-The thing is thin, which is great for sliding it into my backpack-The thing is perty (subjective, but I think it looks mighty fineCons:-The keyboard isn't the best I have ever used, but it's better than the keyboard on a Mac and it lights up-The F keys default to their laptop function (i.e. brightness, volume, etc.) so I can't refresh a webpage without pressing Fn + F5 (it's more annoying than you might think)-The fingerprint reader takes a couple tries sometimesThings that differed from what I saw in reviews:-The fan issues were INSANE when I first booted it up. But after I installed the updates they were gone completely and it doesn't get hot anymore, so that's nice.-The WiFi card wasn't amazing or anything, but it wasn't bad by any means. I can access the campus WiFi and the WiFi in my apartment easily from every range that I will ever need.-The CPU speed is fine. It handles multitasking well and will be snappy for web browsing, Microsoft Office programs, VMs, and the usually coding tasks. I swear to God some people expect a $500 dollar laptop to be a god tier workstation for their 69-dimensional rendering software that they use to make contemporary art.-It has 8 GB's of RAM, don't open 100 tabs and you will be fine. I honestly believe some of these reviewers have dementia and they open a new window every time they want to see what's happening on Yahoo! News.
29	tv	"this is an awesome laptop great for editing film. the imaging and speed are top notch.  the sound card could be better, but not enough to take a way a star. i don't know what the other reviewer meant by slow wi-fi, it's the same load speed as my son's 12"" macbook. excellent value!"
30	tv	This computer is excellent for the price! I purchased this laptop for my Daughter for under $200 dollars! I bought it for her for Christmas so she could play her Sims4 on it. With the memory that is built in it, the Windows 10, and all the updates you couldn't really download a huge game like the Sims4. So I went to Staples and bought a 64 GB flash drive for $20 dollars and now she is able to download and play all kinds of games including her Sims. This computer is made for just Web browsing, Work, or School work but if you have the extra money to get a SD card or Flash Drive and you want to use it to play games, I would suggest doing these options first before getting an external hard drive. I know my Daughter loves it. I also bought the rainbow keyboard to go with it! Now she can have it to play games which I am happy because that's what I initially bought it for! You definitely can't beat the price! One happy customer! 😁
31	tv	I'm not a computer genius not very picky about products so this computer is perfect for me. I typically only use a computer to browse the internet, make Shutterfly books, listen to music, and watch shows. This computer is perfect for that. Lightweight, operates well, vibrant colors, and pretty self explanatory.
32	tv	I wish I would of listened to the reviews on this laptop before buying it. I also wish I could return it.As others have said the storage is horrible. I have a constant low storage icon that I can do nothing about. I have nothing downloaded on the laptop just the stuff it came with. Because of this I cannot download any antivirus protection because there is no room. The battery life sucks, at a full charge I get maybe an hour of unplugged battery life. There is no internal fan to cool the system so it gets really warm. The biggest annoyance I have is after an hour or two the laptop needs to be restarted to refresh it. I was in the middle of typing when my keys stopped working, the only one that would work is the P and all that did was try to get me to print the page I was on.It is no good for streaming Amazon Prime movies/shows because they do not load all the way and buffer every 5-10 minutes.The pros are it is lightweight, the color is nice vibrant purple and that is about it.
33	tv	"Love it, love it, love it.  A full size keyboard, with very limited memory.  I solved the memory issue, by adding a SDHD card, and two USB thumb drives.  I use one thumbdrive for business records, and the other for personal (photos, etc.).  I have had my machine for 3 years, and it is going strong.  No problems, other than the limited memory issue.  You can't always add bulky software, unless you strip out a lot of other ""stuff.""However, most software solutions are online now, and it has not been an issue for me.  I love this machine so much, as it is priced right for the projected life span of the technology (I usually replace my computer every 3 years or so).  I have gifted this machine to three family members, who also love it.  It is NOT a desktop computer, and it does not have the memory for a lot of bulky programs.  But, nearly 100% of my tasks are completed on Microsoft office suite (Word, Excel), or online.  Highly recommend."
34	tv	Just got my laptop last Wednesday and right off the bat...Kept getting low storage messages. Turns out the storage was 25 outta 29.9 already used. Tried factory reset..nothing. Took this laptop to U.P.S. today..on return for my refund. BE CAREFUL!
35	tv	 At first everything was great then the sound started messing up like skipping.... and the picture kept blinking in and out.... took forever to stop so I could restart the computer again. So I restarted it.. it was okay for a bit then it started again.
36	tv	Please note this product is refurbished -- not new. I mention that because ever since I got it had glitches and problems -- the types of glitches that happen on old computers with overwhelmed and fragmented hard drives, freezing up and acting clunky in general. I was trying to get by with it regardless, until finally yesterday (less than a month after purchase), I got a pure black screen that cannot seem to go away or be fixed. The only function that works is the F4 key, which is pretty useless if you ask me. Fortunately for me today is the last day it can be returned before being stuck with it -- so luckily I'll be able to get a refund.
37	tv	This computer was very cheap because it was refurbished. It advertised free Microsoft 365 for a year. I was unable to get a hold of the seller to get the 365. My emails were left unanswered by the seller.The computer is very light in weight. It is also very slow!
38	tv	I was worried cuz of the reviews but I'm so glad I ordered it. Its light weight. Nothing busted and runs really fast with my internet. I'm thinking of ordering another one for my son. This one doesnt have DVD slot. Which is fine with me. I'm using it for work and it keeps up with everything I have to do. Works great with my printer and I couldnt be happier honestly.  Thanks seller so very much. People also said something about the lighting on the screen and I have not had any problems so far. If you want a great computer at a great price. Order this one.
39	tv	This was exactly what I needed. My daughter wanted her first laptop for Christmas. Once I finally received it (I will explain later) I opened it. It was well packaged and completely free from any signs of use or damages. It looked brand new. It started right away. I did the entire set up process with no issues. It seems like a very good starter computer. I am overall very happy with my purchase. After a few months of searching this is like a perfect match for what I needed.Now to the comment when I received it. There was an issue with the shipping that was NOT the sellers fault. There have been several issues in my area with local mail. When my package didn't arrive when it should have I contacted the seller. They immediately contacted me back and completely resolved all issues.
40	tv	I enjoy the large screen, the speed, the color- overall I am happy with the performance and to my surprise there even is a feature for a DVD. I did a lot of research before I made the purchase, for computers under $400, this is the BEST deal I can find on Amazon.com.  
41	tv	I wanted a smaller laptop I could use when I didn't feel like going to sit in the office to work on the computer; I didn't want to spend a bunch of money, since my regular PC was so expensive already. I looked through tons of specs and reviews... tried a chromebook first, which was great, but for the price I wanted something with windows (not just an expensive glorified tablet).This machine LOOKS great. It is sleek, the color is excellent, the keyboard is a great size and very comfortable to use, and it has more than adequate storage for my needs... however, this is where my Pro's list ends. The screen quality is mediocre at best. But the REAL down fall is how S L O W and noisy this machine is!! Even browsing Amazon, everything takes f o r e v e r. And there is a loud whirring anytime you try to use it that is simply distracting because it is so loud.I really wanted to like this computer; the specs were good, the price point was good ($299), it looks beautiful, it is comfortable to type on... But sadly it is being returned after less than an hour of use because the performance is just excruciating. I have tried Lenovo tablets and a Lenovo chromebook, and frankly I really had hoped they would do better with computers than the other devices.
42	tv	I bought a red one for my boy and a purple one for my girl.  She loves this beautiful color, The purple chassis makes it out of ordinary. She said she can finish her homework projects faster. The AMD processor is fast for daily tasks like web browsing and watching videos on youtube etc. which is what I use this system for. System has 8GB of ram, enough to run basic app, even you can use it to play light computer games. 256GB SSD provides faster boot and Read/Write speed than the HDD. it is unnecessary to do any upgrade.I will to buy another purple for myself as a Christmas gift.:-)
43	tv	Computer arrived with a defective speaker.  Updated all software and confirmed all drivers and hardware were operating properly.  Seller refused to ship out a replacement speaker (worth $7) but directed me to Amazon to return item, which was inconvenient.  Overall, the computer is a good unit and will probably give great service once I have the speaker replaced MYSELF
44	tv	I bought this laptop for my wife and she loves it. It's fast (SSD drive), has 8GB of RAM, HDMI, DVD-RW drive, 15.7 inch display screen. etc. It's a home run for us and the price was awesome!
45	tv	This laptop looks great and works well, very good value for the price. my only one issue is that the processor maxes out when opening certain programs but after it opens properly there  are no issues. perfect for home users.
46	tv	I received this laptop today and I cannot connect to the Internet. I have been on the phone with Lenovo for over four hours today and no one is able to get it to work. It says I should “Type my credentials” and enter my “Network Security Key.” I’ve tried every password and network ssid and nothing works. I’m sending this back tomorrow unless someone can answer this simple question! PS, I have a Verizon D-Link modem that works perfectly well with my other laptop and phone.
47	tv	We got this for my 10 year old for her birthday. The color is gorgeus, 2-toned purple. She will use it mainly for You-tube and Roblox. The graphics on Roblox look great. I am no techy, so I can't comment on the specifications. She just got it yesterday so I will add some updates if any issues come up. She loves it so far, she was happy there was a DVD player as well.
48	tv	 I LOVE the colors! The outside is a deeper plum purple and the inside is a lighter lilac color. Definitely worth the money! Only took 10 minutes to set up, if that.
49	tv	"I have owned desktop computers since 1993.  Whenever I considered buying a laptop, it seemed like a frivolous extra, one that cost at least as much as a desktop.  In recent years, I bought two inexpensive amazon Kindle tablets, but they are designed for entertainment only.  I wanted to do some work on a portable device.  This year, I searched YouTube for reviews of laptops & found one by The Deal Guy of this laptop.  He called it a fantasic deal for the price & compared it to a $2700 Apple MacBook, finding it to be only a few seconds slower.  He praised the quality of the keyboard & the inclusion of a DVD-RW drive.  He provides a link to the exact model on amazon.com.  With a 15.6"" screen, 8 GB of RAM (which equals my Dell desktop), & a 256 GB solid state drive, which is noticeably faster than the mechical hard drive on my desktop, it seemed well worth $300 to experience my first laptop computer.  Having used the Lenovo for a month, I am not disappointed.  Some reviewers have criticized the quality of the display.  I find that I need to tilt the screen to its optimum angle of view.  I haven't tried editing photos on it, other than cropping & resizing.  I think my desktop Dell monitor is more reliable for editing photos' for accurate brightness & color saturation.  The solid state drive boots up minutes faster than my desktop.  I had occasion to take it on several trips for hospital visits & found its speakers superior to my Fire 8"" HD tablet for playing music from the drive, the Internet & CDs.  I was able to read & write e-mail & keep my journal up to date while away from home.  I found that Windows 10 enables a copy & paste between computers via the Internet.  I am no longer tied to the desktop in our study but can use the laptop in our living room or on the futon overlooking our backyard.  I do like the feel of the keys.  I find a touchpad touchy & bought a wireless mouse instead.  Pressing the F6 key disables the touchpad.  I find much more use for the function keys (Volume, brightness, & etc.) on the laptop than I have for any of my desktops.  The battery life is supposed to be 5-6 hours, but, like friends of mine, I use it plugged into a wall socket most of the time.  I saw a review of a Lenovo 330, but it had an Intel processor & a mechanical hard drive, which makes comparisons between Lenovo 330s useless unless they have identical specifications."
50	tv	Very nice full sized laptop / speedy and functional/ I use a usb mouse wireless mouse though, I don’t like the internal mouse pad / screen is big and the graphics are beautiful- keyboard is very smooth-  good purchase for not a lot of money - still hate windows 10 though, no matter what box it’s wrapped in.  BUT had to return it because the fan was faulty! Multiple crashes and error messages regarding faulty fan!!
51	tv	"I bought this laptop because it was a good price for the specifications. Got a SSD and 16 GB RAM for much less than other models. I know why it costs less. First hassle on the list is the fact that this computer comes with Windows 10 installed with ""S"" Mode enabled. This isn't a total deal breaker as it can be turned off if you can get connected to Microsoft without experiencing an error message that says, ""it appears you aren't connected to the internet"" even after having a connection to Wi-Fi. Once you install updates, and then reset windows store by typing into the search WSRESET and selecting WSRESET.EXE that fixes that issue. Now to hassle number 2, the internet connection was noticeably slower on this machine because it had a horrible WiFi network adapter installed on it. It doesn't recognize 5G networks, and is incredibly slow compared to other devices I have running on my network. To remedy this, it involves buying another adapter and installing it into the machine. It isn't too expensive, but this is 2020 and this computer was manufactured in 2019, so this is no excuse for HP to put such a terrible WiFi adapter in this thing. Other than those hassles, everything else seems to work fine. The machine boots up fast, runs and executes apps and programs quickly. You would be better off skipping this one for another budget laptop if you want hassle free setup. I purchased a Lenovo earlier in the year and didn't experience any of these issues. Lenovo L340-17 17.3 Inch HD Laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U up to 3.70 GHz, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, Bluetooth, DVD, WiFi, Windows 10) (Gray) You can find it here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TVR5TP3/?coliid=I1TLIFFOW1R48X&colid=12EVLS1XQO9MA&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_itThis computer has comparable features and costs less.2/7/20I ended up having to return this laptop because the hard drive crashed in it. I would pass on this one altogether. It looks like HP put the cheapest possible components in this machine and it didn't even last a month out of the box new."
52	tv	This is a decent laptop. I did have to get online with tech support to get it working normally right at first, which was frustrating.
53	tv	"This machine is really excellent. I ordered it with a 6-day delivery promise and it came in two. I purchased the 512GB SSD with 16GB Ram option. It is really fast - about 30 seconds from power on to internet. Amazing! The screen is nice and large and the picture quality is really good. About the only thing I regret is that it keeps coming down in price - it started at $609, went to $595 (that's when I went for it), and now, a few days later it's $585. Oh well, it is what it is. Let me address some of the issues others have mentioned.1. Slow wifi. Not mine!2. Getting it out of Windows 10 S-mode. It's easy to find instructions with an internet search.3. Setup hassles. Setup is always a necessary evil because of software, drivers and the bios, all of which get improved between the time the machine leaves the factory and the when you unbox it. Here is what I did:-Unbox and plug in the power cord. Hard connect your laptop to your wireless router via an ethernet cable. Turn the machine on and follow the setup prompts. Once you make it to the desktop, disable S-mode using the link above. Then go to Start->Settings->Update and Security. Once there, click ""Check for Updates"". Mine had a pile of them. Let the updates install until there aren't any more or until you aren't able to successfully complete 2 or 3 (they will succeed on there own). Once I did that, I took the laptop off the ethernet cable and set up my wifi. Next, find ""HP Support Assist"" in your start menu. Run it and let it install any updates it recommends. For me, it updated 3 drivers and the bios. Just follow the prompts and directions and you will be fine. Be especially careful if it updates the bios because if you don't do what the instructions say, you can brick your new laptop.Once all of that is finished, you should be good to go. Good luck with this HP. You will really enjoy it!"
54	tv	The laptop is realy fast! I like it as well as the seller. He is realy client oriented and solved my problem quick and successfully. Realy glad to have this laptop. I completely recomend this thing and this trader.
55	tv	I am not happy with it to say the least.  I contacted HP and they referred to someone who wanted money to fix the problem after I had spent close to $300.00 to set it up which was also a problem in itself.
56	tv	So far so good on day one. Setup was easy and the computer runs super fast. Will update if things change.
57	tv	"I purchased this laptop and received it on Jan 18, 2020.  I'm posting for others who may purchase this laptop around this time and can't get out of Windows s-mode (s-mode prohibits downloads of anything that is not in the online Microsoft store.  So, for example, if you need Google Chrome or Firefox you cannot download them).  After two days of trying to get out of Windows 10 s-mode following the Micorosoft instructions on how to do so, I found out that the Online Microsoft Store was malfunctioning.  The ""get"" button in the online store, required to get out of s-mode, is not working in the Microsoft online store as of this writing.  Fortunately I saw on the Microsoft (brick&mortar) Store Twitter that you can make a free appt to visit the Answer Desk at the store no matter where you purchased your computer.  The day of my appt (1/20/2020) at the Microsoft Store, the ""get button"" glitch was still happening and the representative at the physical store said it's an online store problem, not the computer or Windows 10.  The way he worked around it was to create another sign-on acct on the PC, somehow this tricks the ""get button"" glitch.  He finished up by switching back to the PC sign-on acct that I created.When I signed up for the appt at the physical store, I also signed up for their ""Getting to Know Windows 10"" workshop at the store at the mall.  I am begrudgingly coming from Windows 7.I also noticed other glitches with the online Microsoft Store, for example, items cannot be removed from your cart.Back to the laptop, I've only spent one ""quality"" day with it after getting out of s-mode, but it has a nice feel, no problems with the trackpad or keyboard and the big screen is wonderful!  If you plan to carry it around, you'll need a extra long laptop case.  It is big in size, but not too heavy."
58	tv	Had the computer for only 3 days and the day I go to use it, it crashes the processor died. Was doing updates and it crash.HP can have it back it's in the mail. I've never had a computer crash until now. Don't know if I'll buy another HP and I have had 8 and never a problem.  Maybe it was the windows 10 that did it?
59	tv	Bought this for my X wife (we are still friends), as she needed a Win 10 machine just like most of us being forced to upgrade from the 7 world. The dreaded S mode people speak of does not seem to be a problem for her, and she was able to load everything she had on 7, just as I have been able to do, including Microsoft 2007, and other older software packages. The  only other thing required, was to find a free dvd player online, as win 10 will only read cd's.
60	tv	I bought this CF0014DX computer because it seemed an acceptable package at (relatively) affordable price.  I returned it because the network adapter is terrible in my environment.  After finding better options for the buck, I realize this computer is a poor investment for most people.Spending $400 for a computer with an I3 processor is not great.  I know it is fast enough for most tasks.The network adapter here is only single band, 2.4 Ghz, 802.11bgn.  This old, over-used standard is a foolish corner-cut by HP.  Even $100 android tablets now include 5 GHZ, 802.11ac WIFI.  With the older technology you are poorly equipped to fight for bandwidth in the increasingly congested WIFI environment.  In my neighborhood I got single digit MHz downloads with the CF0014DX:  OK for most web surfing, lousy for video streaming.  With an 802.11ac adapter I get 150 MHz to 200 MHz downloads – an astonishing improvement.The good news if you already own a laptop with 2.4 Ghz WIFI is you can easily upgrade with a USB WIFI dongle costing less than $15.  There are many options, I recently had success with this one:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LFXN1SJ/The CF0014DX computer only has two USB ports.  Having to buy a WIFI dongle for a new computer and fill up a precious USB port is unacceptable.The other impractical aspect of this package is that the SSD is only 128 GB.  It may seem passable for you today, but 256 GB is a realistic longer term minimum for most.I bought a better version of this computer for just $70 more: model  HP 14-cf0051od with 256 GB SSD.  Some listings show it having the older WIFI standard, but it certainly has an 802.11ac network adapter.  The processor is noticeably much faster; it will seem fast for several years longer than the CF0014DX.I see the Lenovo IdeaPad 530S 14”, similar in specs to my HP 14-cf0051od,  on sale at big box for lower price.  It has advantage over the two HPs of higher res graphics and ability to upgrade RAM.  But no buyer’s remorse here, I have long history with HP computers and am thrilled with my cf0051od.Buying a refurbished HP Elitebook or Dell Latitude on Amazon would also be a better value than the CF0014DX.  I am a big fan of buying refurbished desktop computers (sans monitor) because they can be upgraded easily.  I’m shyer about refurbished laptops because they are more delicate; you can’t just swap in new keyboard, mouse or monitor; many things can be wrong with them.  Take a risk on a refurbished laptop if you are fine with evaluating and potentially returning.
61	tv	I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop).The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places.Pros:- Boots up in seconds- Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix- Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors- SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be- Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV'sCons:- The Bloatware, so dumb and useless- No others right nowAgain my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one.Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features. Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop.
62	tv	I'm really only using this laptop for three things-Internet browsing-word processing via (google docs)-emails*possibly light gaming such as hearthstone or solitaire/sudukoFor it's three main uses it functions very well. I mainly use this laptop for school. The 8gb of ram are plenty for my needs and the hard is ok which I'll get into.Connections-2 usb ports (one of them is a 2.0 and one of them is 3.0) however when you at the side of the laptop you cant tell which one is which cause they both look the same and the small guide that come with the laptop does not show you which is which, but that's ok for me.-1 headphone/mic combo jack-1 HDMI port (this is particularly good if you plan to mirror you screen to a television)-1 ethernet connection (RJ-45) this is the basic ethernet connector most people use-1 power adaptor port-1 usb C port-1 card reader (which I haven't used yet)-1 connector to hook up a locking cable for you laptop (I probably will never use this but cool feature anyways)After opening the box-I like that it is a very light weight laptop which is great for traveling and school-the keyboard feels fantastic (much better than my previous lenovo)-the track pad works well and if you look at one of my photos it has some special features that allow you to zoom in on the screen and use in a way similar to a smart phone (these features also apply to the touch screen version of this laptop but the laptop I am reviewing is not a touch screen) I personally prefer a laptop with out the touch screen feature-The description says that the hard drive is a 128 GB SSD. It is indeed a SSD but they maximum capacity is 118 GB and after OS installation, windows updates, and some basic apps, the storage left over is about 80 GB. This is ok for me. When you think about it 80 GB is still a lot of storage space, and I have a 1TB external hard drive that im using to store most of my files. Also If you prefer there are many ways to get free cloud storage such as dropbox or google drive. If you plan to store large videos and/or massive amounts of photos I would recommend getting and external hard drive. (keep in mind this laptop does have a card reader so you could also get yourself a some kind of sd card for storage space as well) Also this laptop comes in a 256 GB storage capacity, I'm guessing after the formalities it's closer to 225 GB.-The screen looks good. Its clear and bright (adjustable). great definition-The sound is ok. It really the same as you would expect for any laptop. I will be using my song headphone if I feel like getting better sound-There is a little fan that runs, but you will hardly notice it.-The laptop top does come with some bloat ware but you can sort that for your self or just keep. ( you might not even notice the difference)-The cold start time is about 8 seconds (that's really fast!)Things to Note-Don't buy the expert setup. Save yourself the 80 dollars and buy some accessories. The setup is simple and the laptop will walk you through the process (nothing major to do). All I did was plug in the laptop to an outlet, turned it on, and cortana walks you through the process. It only take about five minutes. Add another five minutes to run windows update and download/install the newest updates. It really is easy.-This laptop does not have a CD drive. It says so in the description on amazon. I'm just pointing it out for those who skipped straight to the review section.-If gaming is your biggest concern I would not suggest this laptop. It does have a decent processor and amount of ram, but it's more for general use and apps that consume less of your cpu power.-Amazon offers a warranty. You can get it if you want; that part is really up to you, and depends on how much abuse you think you might put your laptop through. If you're on the fence about the warranty, HP themselves offer a warranty that you can purchase after the fact when you setup the laptop for the first time. I believe it cost 80 dollars for three years.In conclusionIf you feel like you identify with the student/worker/average person who needs a laptop for travel and general use, you can purchase this laptop knowing it will perform well for you. HP is a great brand and makes reliable computers. I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who plans to use it for school.
63	tv	"I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse. This is a basic laptop that functions well for a great budget price. I bought this for the online classes I am taking and some light internet browsing, aka Pinterest, Facebook, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or for if you need any software like AutoCad, photo editing software or for work purposes. This is a great personal use computer and for school depending on your degree.  I immediately uninstalled the game pack that came with it. I wish you could uninstall the other bloatware that comes with it, unfortunately I am having a hard time finding it to uninstall. There are so many ""trials"" for games, dropbox, etc. that I don't want popping up all the time hence the 4 stars."
64	tv	"I bought this in a rush when my Dell died suddenly.  I basically looked at price and the reviews.  I was interested in a home laptop to use for emails, surfing, and Office applications.  I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.  Good battery life, nice size (14"" seemed a lot smaller than my 17"" Dell, but as noted in other reviews, the design of the keyboard gives me the same keyboard area as my Dell) and it's very lightweight.  No complaints at all.  For the money I think this is a very nice laptop."
65	tv	I've only had this for a day, but it looks great in terms of speed and ease. Looks like a good laptop for the price. I will be using it basically for writing and browsing the internet. There was a lot of MS bloatware though, that I got rid of. Only thing, description says Ash Silver, I got Gold. Other than that- looks good. Seller: TechFamily.
66	tv	I bought this with on a tight budget. Even though I was kinda doubtful about it having an i3 processor, I am very satisfied with it. I'm currently using it in a nursing program, where I take exams online. It hasn't lagged or frozen during my exams, yet. Hopefully it'll stay like this for the next 2 years. I don't do anything else on it except for school related stuff, and it is runs good enough for my needs.
67	tv	"Some reviews compared to a Macbook, which is unfair. This computer costs 1/3 price and you should expect some trade offs for saving that $1000. I am using it only for internet access and simple word processing, spreadsheet tasks. Does those jobs admirably. It is a bit slow to start up and needs a nudge to connect ""automatically"" to my trusted wifi networks. But nothing a couple of seconds patience won't overcome."
68	tv	I'm a college student so I needed a laptop that was lightweight, portable, good battery life, and can run multiple programs at once (i.e. Excel, Word, Chrome). I've had this laptop for almost four months now and it has met all of my needs and then some! Battery lasts all day, laptop is extremely light, and I can easily run many programs at once. I got this to replace an older Mac Book Pro, and this is an upgrade in my opinion.
69	tv	Ordered August 16, 2019 for school. The computer was meeting my needs and working great until September 26, 2019. It would not turn on, then I plugged in and the charge light was on, but only momentarily, the light no longer indicates a charge, the battery is hot despite being charged. I tried several outlets, unplugging to let the battery cool, but nothing seems to be working. Just over 30 days and it's dead :( I have contacted seller through Amazon to see how we can fix the problem.I will say that before it stopped working, the screen was great, battery life was good lasting a day of use at school, keys were easy to use, and the speed of the operating system was sufficient for my needs as a law student. I hope there's a remedy for my laptop, I need it back asap.
70	tv	THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE WINDOWS 10 VERSION NOT CHROME OS. ALSO ANYONE HAVING THE KEYBOARD DIE ON THEM PLEASE TRY DISCONNECTING THE LAPTOP, TURNING OFF COMPLETELY, AND HOLD THE TINY BATTERY RESET BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM FOR 15 TO 30 SECONDS AND IT SHOULD WORK FINE.Okay so I did a bit of digging around and a bit of research and i decided to get this laptop in the end. The purpose of my purchase was small size, portability, value, and versatility. A cheap, but very usable, compact laptop i could take with me anywhere.You get 4gb of ram and 64gb of ssd for only 140ish which is pretty good compared to other laptops with similar specs, ESPECIALLY considering that a lot of other options offer Win10 only in S mode OR GOD FORBID CHROME OS.Now right out of the box I can see in the system the storage is closer to 35 gb of free storage with win10 installed which is a bit like the air in chip bags. A necessary evil. The memory can be upgraded with an SD card, I have a 128 GB Sandisk and it works quite well for installing apps and games.The speed is kind of slow but i wasnt expecting a power horse gaming pc from this little thing.The durability seems good. A fairly strong and heafty textured plastic (the very nice kind). The weight is great, so light and small! Obviously you dont want to drop this little guy, like any laptop.I tested Steam games such as Stronghold Crusader, Half Life Source, and Deus Ex 1 and they ran with no lag. Newer games most likely will suffer performance issues. Some games are more optimized than others so keep that in mind.All in all if you need a small laptop for working, typing, homework, its pretty good! But its not going to run no PUBG or GTA V.
71	tv	This is where I'm making my review from now. I would usually not make reviews but I feel deeply that it is my duty as a person who has a little more than common knowledge of computers to relay this information to anyone scouring for a super cheap, computer they need now! This doesn't have an abundance of space but if you're a first year college student, like me, you don't need it. I bought this to only be used briefly for a year and a half (for all of my prerequisite classes) and I plan to sell it later and purchase a near $600 laptop to use for my engineering courses. This gets the job done, is very convenient, multipurpose, and when you just wanna wind down and watch a good Netflix show, it's perfect for that as well. I got to download a lot of my course applications on here already and everything runs so smoothly. Another thing is that the setup is relatively simple and pretty fun. I've had this laptop for a little over a few weeks now and I definitely don't regret my decision of purchasing. I might even keep this laptop and give it to my younger brother when he starts college soon.
72	tv	Amazing deal. Not the quickest on the market, but a workhorse nonetheless. For those looking for a budget alternative to a pricy laptop, look no further. ChromeOS honestly takes care of most of your basic office needs with the Google suite of apps (Slides for Powerpoint, Docs for Word, Sheets for Excel). All are office compatible. That combined with the cloud services you get from your Google Account. You're off and running. Note, this is a refurb so expect some blemishes. While the screen was perfect, the case had a major scratch (gave me a reason to add one of my daughter's marvel stickers ;-). I challenge you to find a better deal at $200.
73	tv	"I really like this Chromebook. I should say that this is my first experience with a Chromebook, so it has taken some getting used to. I'm not a fan of the printing. I wouldn't knock a star off for it though, because it's a personal preference due to what I am used to with microsoft products. The options for how to print are different and vary. Example would be that I cant use powerpoint and make it so my powerpoint lecture notes will print 3 slides to one page. I only have the option really to print double sided. Also when trying to print from the internet, it wont let me print ""fitted to page"" at times. I know this is likely an operator error. So take it with a grain of salt. Battery life is great. I take it with me to school and it keeps up nicely, unlike my Lenovo laptop that I may as well have plugged in 24/7. I have noticed it will last a few days if I am only using it on and off (without the need of shutting it off completely). If I am on it for hours straight to do school work it lasts 8 hours. Could last up to 10 depending on what you are doing. I use it for looking up information and watching a lot of lectures. Also for doing math homework on mymathlab.com.  Hope this helps"
74	tv	Exactly what my 9 yr old needed! She uses this for e-learning (Google classroom), educational websites (ABC mouse,etc ), and to practice typing skills.
75	tv	Second time a defective computer was sent!! Do not purchase. First computer would not even turn on and second computer had hard drive issues and no windows installed. On top of that it will take 7 days after the computer is returned  to get a refund 🤬 Ruined my daughter’s Christmas gift ...
76	tv	Didn't work properly right out of the box. Sent back the same day it arrived, never buying refurbished again.Does refurbished mean you just re-package it and send it to somebody else? If anyone had bothered to turn mine on let alone test it they would have seen it was defective. Waste of time.
77	tv	I actually purchased this chromebook to use for work and so far (several weeks later), I haven't had any issues accomplishing my work on this little machine; I work as a digital marketer if you are curious about making the switch to chrome OS.The good:Processing speed and Ram is just right for emails, social media, ad managers, streaming videos/music.The textures all over the laptop feel great and quality.The screen is a decent touch screen and gets quite bright. The screen size is pretty small, but I haven't had any real problems, and I anticipate buying a second screen for when I'm not working mobile.Battery life is fantastic. I can work while streaming music all day and still have 30% to go the next day when I start it up!The bad:I manage typing on the keyboard all day sometimes, but it's really not that fun. The keys are a rough plastic texture, have a bit too much travel, and aren't spaced very well. Regardless, I hook up another keyboard at the office and that works just fine.The track-pad is pretty poor. I really don't like using it. The physical click is ROUGH (and yes I had to use alt+searchkey to type that :P), it's a small surface, and the two finger scroll/three finger window switch is at times either very touchy or not responsive enough. Once again though, hooking up a mouse that you like to use instead works just fine.Overall, if you are looking for a neat little laptop to do some casual internet work or browsing on, this is a fantastic piece of tech, and the 2-in-1 ability is really fun. I highly recommend, but I would also recommend saving a bit more for a higher-end chromebook if you intend to do any serious amount of work on your laptop.
78	tv	I loved everything about this labtop. This is for school and game playing. I couldn't ask for a better labtop. Touch screen is amazing. I'm able to listen to music on YouTube same time I do school work in tablet mode. It's absolutely amazing. Never had a labtop like this. Best labtop Acer ever made. Huge tablet screen also. It came being started up. Had full battery. No finger prints like other reviews, and great packaging as well. Came with right cord. Fast and best delivery. Might be refurbished but it's the best I have ever had. Not one problem with my labtop.
79	tv	"They bunched this laptop in with a bunch of very different products. Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking I was getting a touch screen and an SSD. Mixing product reviews needs to stop.The ""refurbish"" was they put stickers on the surface to try to make it look not so beat up. But they only succeeded in making it look like an even cheaper product."
80	tv	I was looking for a laptop with great performance, a good screen and no need to upgrade Ram and hard drive. Obviously, this laptop is a good choice for me. It comes with numeric pad and 8GB Memory/256GB SSD, it also provides enough RAM and faster boot SSD.  I bought a red one for my boy and a purple one for my girl.The good:1 - This is a very fast laptop with 8GB of memory and 256GB SSD2 - It has a quick charging feature.3 - The keyboard is very good for quick typing.4 - There are lights for the num lock, caps lock and power.5 - It has a DVD drive6- it has Numeric keyboard while nowdays a lot of computer no anymore have numeric keyboard.The not so good: no backlit keyboard.however, For this $300+ laptop, we can’t ask more. If you compare the computers among the same budgets, this is the BEST deal you can find. It is good as a daily computer for shopping, web browsing, YouTube, or student for home work, Microsoft Office.
81	tv	Was well past time to upgrade laptop, and picked this up on cyber Monday. So far, so good but big learning curve with new buttonless mouse. Easy set up. I like that it's not your average black laptop, but color is much more orangey red than in the picture. Not my fave, but its got personality. Wanted a CD drive, SSD and plenty of USB ports, and this delivers at a reasonable price.
82	tv	"Excellent laptop! Price is ""okay"" for the time, but next time I'll probably wait for a better deal. The t480 might be a better model as it comes with a backlit keyboard and few other goodies this one doesn't have..Ctrl and fn are in a weird place but that can be swapped in settingsI wish battery was a little better but it's fine"
83	tv	Excellent computer. Easy step by step set-up. 8 hour battery life.
84	tv	Color is NOT accurate in the product photo. It makes it look cranberry or maroon.It's more of tomato red to be accurate. Looks like a toy more than anything.
85	tv	This is an awesome laptop...it is sturdy and works beautifully...it also has a built in bed player...well worth the money with 40% off....the color is gorgeous----not red or orange-- but a beautiful coral color and the keyboard is almost pinkish but very subtle....thank you
86	tv	The computer for the cost seems fast, has a reasonable amount of space and RAM.  Nice design.  This is a low end machine and for the money seems worth it.  It has a DVD drive, number keys and a decent screen.  It seems well built.  Like others my concern is w the battery.  Doesn't seem to keep a charge as much as I would have liked yet I haven't modified the battery settings that much and it is comparative to low end machines that are true laptops.  That being said I am running some basic stuff including MacAfee that was pre loaded.  For now I am pleased w Lenovo and received a good response for customer service regarding a question.  I don't think this is a machine you can overload w apps yet so far it is running what I need very well.  If I purchased a similar name brand I would have paid more and wouldn't have received a better  device.  My experience is they forget you purchased from them after a yr and want money for support.
87	tv	I purchased the Ideapad 330 for $308, thinking this was a good laptop for general documents, emailing & such. Incuded Office 10, which was a win for me. HOWEVER, after being asked for the product key & getting no response from Lenovo, I called Amazon. They contacted Lenovo & told me that the TRIAL version for Office is what the PC came with. NOT AS ADVERTISED. I will be returning this product, so sad. Also, came across some articles on line about spyware being installed on Lenovo products.
88	tv	so far I'm enjoying it, but would of been nice to get more info. on how to use window 10
89	tv	Received today and was a dream to set up. Switching from Dell Inspiron back to Lenovo. This is a great business laptop --
90	tv	this thing is awesome! works great...I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for my old apple macbook that just died...I got that one refurbished 4 years ago and used it on my lap while watching tv in my easy chair and casually surfing the internet, no heavy gaming or even taking the laptop out of the house. This unit fit the bill and works great for my purposes, and for what I use it for, actually works better than the old macbook...no slow operation, screen freezing from trying to process all the stuff on different websites...
91	tv	Recently purchased this laptop for my daughter who is in college, she has been using it for a few days now and couldn't be happier, it arrived in very good condition and she has had no issues with it at all. This is a great little laptop for work or school, it has exceeded my expectations, and an overall good value for the money, very happy customer!
92	tv	"It is an ""outdated"" chrome book (won't update OS) but it is still very responsive and works well. It does everything I need, very happy!"
93	tv	Didnt want kiddo using my laptop for her schools google classroom and this seems to be perfect. Solid feeling computer. No visible damage. Battery seems to hold a charge. Runs smooth and had no issues connecting. Only issue I have is with chrome parental controls. There is no way to set controls for accounts on the machine without using family link. This was simple when setting up a gmail account for the kiddo but to use google classroom we had to log in with her school email which defaults to the schools profile which i cannot control and as it is not on the school network all websites are unlocked.
94	tv	I should have researched more before I bought this. I assumed it would be fine since it is a Lenovo. No you are stuck with Google Operating System and no way to use anything else unless you remove the firmware screw and write your own code of custom firmware. Way too much work and risk of bricking device. There is also no right mouse click on the keyboard. No F keys at the top either. This thing is a piece of crap I should have gotten a Dell for same price. First Lenovo I wasn't happy with.
95	tv	Unit was on when I took it from the box. Closing the Lid turns it off. A few days later I powered it off and it never powered on again. Reset methods all failed. It completely Died. No Blinking lights no charge ,just Zilch.
96	tv	I gave 100 buck and this thing is perfect for my needs, which is at work to document on patients . long battery life so I bring it charged and it last 12 hrs..
97	tv	Light, compact and past basic in terms of abilities but, also not advanced(no disc drive) or internet explorer.  Also this Chromebook is updated already enough and will not update any further.  However this is fast and the keyboard works amazing as well as the mousepad built into it.
98	tv	Liked it overall .. it's not as  expensive as other Chromebooks  - and it's a New  .. up to date Model .. and similar to other recent Chromebooks  in the similar Price ranges
99	tv	I just got this Chromebook and can't find if it's Gen 2, 3 or 3. If it's gen 2 or 3 the OS updates have been extended. The Chromebook looks like new it's in perfect condition and works perfectly. I gave it a low star rating simply because the seller did not state it would no longer receive OS updates, I feel like that is very misleading.
100	tv	Great computer for the price.  It is a 64 bit computer.  The 3g isn't the latest version but it does have enough capabilities to play back movies, displaying books, and playing music.  Very easy to setup to use right out of the box as long as you have a Google account.This is probably the best notebook computer I have ever owned to boot up right away when the power button goes on.If you need to connect to a Linux server using ssh, this will do the job.The battery life is excellent since there are only sold state components in the device.  I can use it for up to 12 hrs without plugging it in.Windows remote desktop works with a paid app available.Even though these are marketed for security that doesn't mean you shouldn't use a VPN.  Chromebooks have a specific way of using one. OpenVPN file format for Linux won't woek unless you convert it to a specific file format using Openssl.Recent updates to the Chrome operating system have allowed hotspot tethering as well as pairing with an Android phone since  this post was started.
101	tv	Worth the price had one nick on it but it’s so small you can’t tell. I gave it to my 10 year old for a first time computer for anyone
102	tv	I ordered it on the 30th of may and it was worth the wait. I inspected the computer and it didn't have anything wrong with it. It had no damages. The only damage was the outside box that the carrier brought.( only a little damage to the box thats it)
103	tv	Does not use Windows os.
104	tv	just received it today & its easy to set up and easy to use for what I need it to do.
105	tv	Great computer for my daughter !
106	tv	For about 100 bucks you get a decent system. My screen came cracked but they refunded nearly half off so I kept it. No worries otherwise.
107	tv	It works good!
108	tv	The usb drive doesn’t work which sucks considering you can’t plug a mouse into it which defeats the whole purpose of having a laptop that doesn’t have a left click or right click button like most laptops do. I can hardly do any of my homework on it.Update: upon further inspection the side is cracked and the laptop has started lagging like crazy. Not worth the hassle.
109	tv	Cumple de manera óptima sus funciones principales, manejo de archivos en la nube, paquetes de oficina de acceso en la nube. Para realizar funciones más específicas se dependen principalmente de extensiones al google chrome. Los principales inconvenientes es que no tiene de manera predefinida la tecla de mayúscula, que por dicha se puede activar y como segundo punto de mejora es utilizar algún otro tipo de material para el touchpad ya que se descascara.
110	tv	"I usually don't write reviews but I think this one is warranted.  This has to be the best ""bang for the buck"" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing."
111	tv	Key Points:- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop- Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry)- Large storage space for basically any consumer need- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)Experience:If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.
112	tv	Product was everything I expected. The laptop was upgraded as stated and came with detailed instructions for how to verify the upgrades.
113	tv	This laptop exceeded all expectations. I've use laptops with previous versions of the Intel core i5 chipset but this one blows them all away. I was expecting an improvement in performance from this 10th gen machine but it was more than I had hoped. It's a fast, snappy and responsive machine, especially for the price point. The touchscreen is responsive and works as expected. The display is vibrant, nice color and resolution. It's even an attractive little machine. If you're looking for something to meet your computing needs but don't want to break the bank, look no further and just buy it. You won't be disappointed.
114	tv	I was really hoping this laptop would meet my expectations. I researched it for 2 weeks comparing it to other options. Each time I’d try to find a reason not to buy it since the price was so much less than others with comparable specs. Well finally went for it. Boy did it exceed expectations. It is blazing fast, extremely light and well crafted.Now if you’re looking for a backlit keyboard and an alloy case(it’s plastic) don’t get it. So if you are rough on your laptop, it might not be for you.  But if you want performance and elegant design, this is definitely the best bang for the buck I have seen.
115	tv	Wery slow!!!!it takes him almost three minutes to start!ad then even to load 'this computer' i have to wait!!!and this is 10th gen i5????my 10 years hp g 64 was so much better!!!dont wayste your money on this!!!very glitcy and dissapointing too bad mr seller!i vant to return it NOW!!!
116	tv	Just received computer today and was very happy to get it up and running. I will be returning it. The display is garbage and that is my own fault for not noticing the pixels when it was ordered, but it still should not be a complete washed out looking. Cheaply made. Keyboard feels like cheap plastic, it IS plastic. The only good thing I will say is that it does seem fairly quick, though no quicker than my old laptop which I am on right now. Fan is always running and noisy.  I don't understand how it got any good reviews.
117	tv	"At first glance, this computer seems to be a steal. 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, quad-core i5 maxing at 3.6GHz and only at $500! It is far from it. At this price, HP has to cut corners, and it's so painfully obvious they did.This laptop comes equipt with the Realtek RTL8821CE 802.11ac WiFi adapter. This piece of hardware is garbage. Don't take my word for it either, do some Google searches on it! Put in the part name + ""disconnect"" and issues come up in abundance. There are a multitude of threads on HPs own website, dating back from 2018 even, about how this WiFi adapter constantly disconnects or misbehave.The ""solutions"" that HP gives to to download a specific driver. Click the link and the file does not exist! And that's if you're able to get that far before the chip disconnects. The first 3 solutions I checked out did this, I'm not going to waste any more time with it right now.Summary: good specs, but the WiFi chip constantly disconnects, even requiring restart to fix it. Happens instantly after reboot sometimes. Stay away from this product until a fix for the WiFi chip is implemented. Planning on returning this headache of a computer unless I can find a fix. This is just so sad because I used to love HP products. Definitely gonna have to think twice before purchasing from them again."
118	tv	I cannot recommend that you look for a different laptop strongly enough. After a month of use, I have had nothing but problems.Main issues:- It runs incredibly slow.- Fan is loud and hot and almost always on.- Battery life is HORRIBLE. Drains in less than an hour on battery saver.Other issues:- I've had problems connecting to wifi.- USB slots are incredibly difficult to connect to.I feel absolutely ripped off by this laptop. The 20% restocking fee they charge for a return is also ridiculous. I feel like I wasted my money. Follow my advice. Don't waste yours.
119	tv	Good laptop for price.  15 second start up from power off.  Fast program processing.  All in all.  Worth the value.  Would have liked to seen the ability to upgrade the ssd hd to a 1 TB ssd hd for an upgrade fee.
120	tv	"Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product  - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor."
121	tv	I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  The return window closed January 31st and it DIED February 20th!  I will NEVER purchase from them again.
122	tv	At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly. After a few informational email exchanges, I have not heard back from him about resolving the issue. I was leery about purchasing a refurbished computer and now wish I had not.
123	tv	Great price... worth every penny apparently. Screej came cracked in the corner and when you turn it on the screen comes on when it feels like. Wish I looked harder. Merry Christmas to me...
124	tv	I thought that when you got refurbished that it worked. I had to replace the battery, the only way you could use this is if it was plugged in. It was also very scratched. Not someplace I would use again.
125	tv	These Dell Chrome Books are really nice! We got them for our boys ages 13 and 11 for Christmas. They use them for homework and playing games! It’s one game that they really play that they can’t play on this chrome book because it doesn’t have windows. Rowblocks is the name of the game I think! Lol.... about two months after getting the books we noticed that they wouldn’t charge and they could only use them if they were plugged in. We contacted the company and sent them back and two weeks later they sent them out knew books. These are working great! Turns out the both of the books had bad battery packs. Customer service was great and I would definitely buy from them again!
126	tv	Four months after product purchased the top half of the monitor stopped working.  Dell would not help since it was purchased from a 3rd party.
127	tv	Don’t purchase my sons screen doesn’t light up. Waste of money.
128	tv	This product arrived broken. The mouse did not move on the screen at all. I knew I was taking a chance but expected a product that at least worked when new. Returned this immediately
129	tv	I really needed an upgrade from my old Dell pc and this definitely did the trick.  The only problem I had with the product were loose screws in the computer.  Fortunately I was able to remove them.
130	tv	"Disclaimer: I am a serious computer geek and a bit of a snob when it comes to tech. Still, this laptop is awesome!!Rating: 5 Stars (because 4.8 isn't an option and 4 is too few for this thing)Model: 12 GB RAM; Ryzen 5 3500UPros:> That price! (Unmatched in performance in this price range!)> Ryzen 5 3500U performs better than the Intel Core i5-8250U.> Vega 8 graphics are fairly capable.> Backlit keyboard is nice and a pleasure to type on> Light and portable> Great port selection.> 12 GB of RAM is sufficient for most daily tasks. (Expandable to 20 GB if your the warranty voiding type)> Decent sound for its class> Comes with a pen that works very well with the software> Great touchscreenCons:> Can't charge via USB-C (Lenovo! Please do this for the next model!!)> Screen brightness is sufficient, but not suitable for outdoor use.> Pen stores very awkwardly (Lenovo! You can really do better!)> McAfee preinstalled, and it resists being uninstalled. (You actually need to download their uninstaller to do it. IMHO its more of a virus than an antivirus.)> Battery life is definitely OK. Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for.My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my ""powerhouse"" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon!TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you."
131	tv	I received this computer on Thursday, marked brand new. 20 minutes after setting up part of my screen glitched up and became pixelated. I gave it a little while and it was fine even though it did it again at other times. Tinkering around, I opened up the drawing pad only to discover there was a drawing already in there. Not a professional demo one, just something someone drew. I called up Amazon and asked if this was refurbished, they said no. I described the issues and they were nice and courteous and are sending out a replacement immediately. Until I receive a brand new one as promised, I will leave my review at 3 stars. It is a great computer, but this issue was a bit of a let down. Make sure you check your products before the 30 day mark expires.
132	tv	"A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1"" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60"") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?)The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason.The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors.Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write with without immediately cramping my hand.The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%.4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them.With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don’t care about the warranty. I’ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don’t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so).The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates.Overall I’m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15” Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work."
133	tv	I bought this to replace an Acer that was stolen, and the price of the Acer went up as I only bought it a few months ago. I went with this Lenovo Flex 14 Ryzen based on a similar model with 8 GB, and I decided to go with this model that had 12 GB based upon the possibility of running multiple programs at once. Some people may be starved with 8 GB, and 2 GB Vega 8 graphics being shared with it. So, based upon first impressions:• Easy setup.• Fast fingerprint scanner.• Excellent performance for the money with the following: Video full HD 1080P, and I think most people have a hard time finding setting then put a bad review. The Ryzen has settings for different uses, so I’d try to figure them out. It’s not a gaming PC, but it has adequate video quality and is way better than Intel 620 HD integrated GPU. Audio (it’s clear and incredible)• Beats Surface Pro (I use one as a work computer).• Fast Charging.Downsides:Lenovo confusing and difficult registration process, although they do make it incredibly easy up buy extended warranty options, and it’s more about the money than service it appears.• The stylus holder uses one USB port and blocks the use of the other ports.• It doesn’t state to turn on or off backlight keyboard by using Fn + Spacebar to turn on or off (not so bad after someone knows), and the backlight doesn't dim automatically.• The plastic body feels a little cheap and flimsy. It can flex and bend a little, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.• 4K video output only.I will return in few months if anything changes...
134	tv	"Awful. I'm so mad I spent $549 + $100 (insurance) + tax on this piece of fecal matter.Pros:-Uses SSD, so it's fast.-Hinge is pretty sturdy after a few days.-Good keyboard layout.Cons:-WORST PEN AND PEN HOLDER IN HUMAN HISTORY. I can't get over how stupid this thing is. The holder is the worst: it takes away one of 2 full-sized USB ports itself, but if you want the pen to stay in the pen holder, you have to go horizontal which blocks both USB-A ports and the pathetic SD slot. Pen eats AAA batteries; why is it not rechargeable? It's supposed to be able to be stored vertically but the hole where the pen tip is supposed to rest and fit the pen tip in for stabilization is too far down and the pen just pops out. The pen is accurate but of the two buttons it has, only one seems to work (the right click). The other one seems to be there for decoration or confusing people. Absolute garbage.-SD card sticks so, so far out of the SD card slot: it's around 60-70% exposed. You will snap one of those eventually if you aren't super careful. I haven't, but I've only had it a few days. Why even have it if you can't even make sure the card isn't somewhat protected?-SSD is small. Only 256GB.-Various software issues including flickering and not being able to download apps, not being able to do side-by-side multitasking.-McAfee and Lenovo bloatware. Please **** yourselves for putting that in there.-Awful documentation. I had to go to the Device Manager to identify the NIC. Their own website doesn't even list it on the ""full"" spec sheet.-It didn't even run Netflix in Edge. It's a Windows machine that can't even do Netflix out-of-the-box.-I couldn't even install Linux Mint or Debian on it because it couldn't identify the Realtek NIC.If you're looking for a decent 2-in-1, look elsewhere. It's terrible."
135	tv	"I was looking for a laptop to serve one purpose: notes and light work loads for college. Nearly any laptop can do that, but this one does it quite well for the price. I was looking for a laptop similar to the Surface Pro, or Surface Go. With the necessary accessories (i.e. pen and keyboard) both Surface products cost well over the price tag of this laptop, and even come with lesser specs. This CPU (Ryzen 3500U) is incredible for what I need this laptop for. As an engineering student, I'm certain it could handle programs like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk products.  Vega 8 graphics are good for regular use, but I wouldn't use it for gaming as I wouldn't want to max the thermals out, but Minecraft and Rocket League would run on low-medium if you absolutely need to. The laptop comes with a pen and USB holder for the pen, and the pen works great. It allows me to use my laptop as my notebook for all classes. Maybe this laptop is for you, and maybe you need something more higher end.PROS:-Sharp 14"" 1080p screen with great colors and great pen accuracy-Battery life easily lasts me 7 hours of use and the charger is very portable.-Slim, light form factor-Very fast, but it is new so I would expect that since it has an SSD.CONS:-Get the higher RAM model, the embedded graphics uses 2 GB of whatever RAM you selected and 6 GB is not enough for school use, 10 GB is though.-Keyboard has a very short travel, takes a while to get used to-Touch pad is mediocre-Pen sometimes has issues with the barrel buttons, very minor gripe.-Build quality is okay at best. Lots of plastic, some flex on the chassis and keyboard, but again, it's relatively cheap.No idea about the longevity of this laptop, but I guess I'll find out in the future. Mine shipped with a year and a half warranty so that is nice. All-in-all, if you're on a tight budget, this laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U and 12 GB ram) will work great for school. If you have a budget larger than $600, opt for something like an HP ENVY x360. It has better hardware and overall quality."
136	tv	"Edit 10/23: This is a very amazing product and I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the horrible wifi/Bluetooth chip. Realtek 8822BE which is known to have many connectivity issues including constant drops of the wifi, slow speeds, or not even able to find any near by wifi altogether! It is even more sad that this product is sold directly from amazon and they can fix the issue themself.I had contacted Amazon customer support which referred me to Lenovo customer support which just wanted me to jump through hoops and wanted me to send them my laptop and said it would take 1+ weeks to ""fix"" the issue or I could pay 70+ dollars for them to do it faster. In truth it would have taken 1 month for anything to actually be fixedDid some research and found it faster and cheaper to buy a completely new wifi card (Intel 9260 no vpro), and installed it myself. It fixed the issue for the most part. So be ready to spend a bit extra if you want this laptop.But overall this is an excellent laptop and I do recommend buying it. Just be really to pay an additional 15ish dollars to get a better wifi chip to fix the issue."
137	tv	If you're looking for the best of both build quality and performance for a reasonable price like I was, it's between this and the asus vivobook with an i5-8250u.The main pro of getting this however is the added graphical performance of the ryzen 5.I recommend getting the 12GB ram variant, it's the only one that makes sense unless you're looking to put in a 16GB sodimm.You wont be disappointed
138	tv	I'm a professional photographer, and needed a beefy, fast and affordable laptop to tether my camera to Adobe Lightroom for tethered shooting of portraits.  I went with the AMD Ryzen version with 12gb of RAM and 256gb SSD.Once I got set up and running, I installed Lightroom and tested a few tethered shots.  They imported quickly, which is exactly what I wanted.  Lightroom & Photoshop run well, so editing on the go is a breeze.  Plus, you can't beat booting from full powered off to into WIndows in under 10 seconds.  Battery life seems to be good, too.  Great little laptop for the money.
139	tv	First off I purchased this as new only to get it and discover it was not. The laptop I received had a non functioning media card reader, strike 1, Strike 2 came in the form of a generic stylus that didn't work and strike 3 was the horrible battery life. The listing totes long lasting battery power 10 hours I got maybe 4 hours if use befor having to recharge, yes I charged it to 100% before inital use. Seeing as how all these things could be caused by it being used not new I opted for a replacement instead if a refund. I will give it one more tey and then make  final deciesion about it and update my review accordingly.Update #1While I am waiting for the replacement to arrive I figured I will try and use the laptop. So much for that. A picture is worth a thousand words in this case. This picture was taken after not even 2 days of use. I unplugged the laptop and it clearly shows 100% charge and says less than 3 hours remaining with the battery saver on.
140	tv	First, the shipping. The outer box contained no packing materials at all and it arrived open. The tape that sealed it was split from one end of the box to the other and completely broken on one end. I was surprised to find the sealed OEM box from Lenovo intact.Second, the warranty. It began on 6/4/19 when OEMGENUINE ordered the laptop from Lenovo and/or opened the laptop to replace the factory HDD with the 512Gb SSD. This reduced the factory warranty by 67 days.The laptop is a good value for the price and is well suited to the purpose for which it was purchased. The laptop is lightweight and the keyboard has a good touch and is very responsive. The display is clear even though relatively low resolution by modern standards. The Lenovo management software makes keeping the OS and device drivers updated an easy task.Since I mainly use laptops as portable computers in areas where I can always be connected to power the battery life isn't all that important. However, use of this laptop in airports or on airplanes while on business travel would not be productive as the battery life is rather short compared to the MacBook Pros I use for other purposes.
141	tv	Careful - product that I received was nothing like what was described.Description of 16GB ram, 512 SSD - received 4GB ram, 500GB spinning hard driveReturning ASAP
142	tv	"This laptop does not have the display specs that it claimed under product description.  It was supposed to have ""15.6-Inch FHD(1920x1080) Display "" but it actually has the lower end panel that only supports 1366x768.  The other specs were correct but the display is a big deal.  Beware this listing.It was sold and shipped to Canada also so good luck getting any warranty repair.  The warranty also only had 8 months remaining for the one I received but after registering it on Lenovo's site it now has a one year warranty.if you don't care about the screen and only want to power this machine provides it is still a good deal."

144	tv	This Lenovo Thinkpad E590 was exactly what I was looking for at a great price.  I prefer the robust construction and solid feel of Thinkpad cases and keyboards as opposed to Dell's and some of the HP's I've had.  This computer came ready to go and with a 512 GB SSD, it's a fast boot.  The battery life is about what you would expect for a laptop of this size....not disappointing but nothing to write home about.  It is certainly sufficient given its size and weight..
145	tv	I ordered this product on Nov 27 and received today (12/02). When I opened it and put the battery and switch it on, its not show up the screen. spent more than 1 hr for trouble shooting.don't want to waste time spending on defective product. returning back now.
146	tv	I bought this to replace an aging laptop and thus far I have not been disappointed at all.  I have used a Lenovo ThinkPad for work for a number of years and been very pleased.  It was a no-brainer for me to purchase a ThinkPad for personal use.
147	tv	"Bought this laptop for one of our employees.  It's very nice and very quick!  Works great for what we need it for.  I don't know what the battery life is yet as we just purchased it but will update my review once he's had it for a while.  This will be my ""go to"" laptop for all of our employees going forward as long as the battery life holds up."
148	tv	Please don't confuse me with a computer techie. I'm not. I'm replacing a older model Lenovo (580) that was given to me used after serving it's previous owner well. But after two years of constant use and never hardly turned off sadly she went the way of the doodoo bird.  What I do like is the fast start up. Mainly I believe to the ssd drive. The overall feel of the chassis is solid. Opening of the lid requires a little use of force I think due too it's nicely made hinges.Screen res is good enough for what I need.Made my next unit I'll upgrade to the model with higher resolution screen and more storage and a DVD drive. I love the Bluetooth 5.0 the connection speed is so FAST now.. added range and great sound.  It's going to take me so time to familiarize myself with Windows 10. I was so good with 8.  But all in all for the cost of the unit,which was fantastic, the benefits and features more than meet my expectations.
149	tv	"I purchased 2 of these new laptops only to have 1 of the chargers stop working within months of purchasing it. I've taken care of the charging cable and only used it at my office desk, so there is no reasonable reason for it to have stopped working so quickly other than it being defective. I was unable to get support and Amazon said it couldn't help either due to the ""30-day"" warranty. A shame since it took me a couple months just to start fully using it as I transitioned off of my old laptop onto this one. Would not recommend and won't purchase again!"
150	tv	"Having used the Lenovo Thinkpad, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, the Acer Chromebook and now the Samsung Chromebook 3, I know that the Chromebook is superior to the other devices.  It is less ""touchy"" than the Thinkpad, which I found too sensitive to touch.  It is almost the same size and weight as my Galaxy Tab 2, plus has the keyboard, which I LOVE!  The Acer is similar but bigger and heavier...not benefits to me.I have one HUGE suggestion for anyone who needs apps from Google Playstore like I did.  My device did not come loaded with the Playstore App but I had researched enough to know it was capable of using it.  After hours of experimentation on my own, I finally called 1-888-891-0696.  They gave me their Chromebook reps, who told me I had to call Google to get the necessary update.  I called 1-844-613-7593 and was told that they used to handle calls regarding the update but they no longer do, so directed me back to Samsung.  This time I called 1-800-SAMSUNG and got a rep that told me they are not capable of doing Google updates, only Google can.  She happened to ask did I have any updates that needed attention on my device.  Being new to the device, I wasn't sure, but she walked me through it and in fact I did.  IT WAS THE GOOGLE PLAYSTORE APP that I needed!!! Problem solved!  Just look down near your photo in the box for the update sign.Once I completed the update and downloaded the Playstore App, I was able to get the Brother printing app I needed, as well as others that I commonly use.Hope this review can save others from the initial hassle I endured because the Chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way."
151	tv	Up until now, I've only ever used Windows computers - desktop and laptop varieties. I was always under the assumption I wouldn't like Chromebooks because I wouldn't be able to download things, but I'm happy to say I'm now a Chromebook fan.Who should buy this?: People looking to mainly use a web-browser and do light-duty activities; somebody needing a lightweight, portable device for on-the-go and don't want to lug around a heavy laptop; anybody on a budget who wants a basic computer.Who SHOULDN'T buy this?: Anybody needing to do heavier tasks such as gaming, video editing, etc.; Those needing to download specialty programs; anybody expecting high-res graphics and the functionality of a Windows PC.Why did I buy it?: I needed a portable laptop for writing and was on a small budget. i also wanted to buy a brand I'm familiar with.Verdict?: I'll definitely buy a more powerful Chromebook in the future now that I know I like this OS. I'm happy I took a shot with this little device and plan to use it for as long as it lasts.Extra Info: You do have access to the Play Store. Not all apps work, but I believe that's with Chromebooks in general and not just this device. Although, more powerful apps such as the larger games might not run (I haven't really tried.) You cannot download external programs outside of Play Store. The display is good, but not great (not high res). Battery life is good. You have to use a Google account to sign in, but you can sign up for one during set-up.Definitely buy if you're unsure about Chromebooks, need a budget computer to do basic web-based tasks, want something that's lightweight and portable.
152	tv	I'm a heavy user and completely in the cloud and this is my only computer. I use it for business. I have it linked to my Android Note 8 (through a third party Chrome app) and it's seamless. It will run apps from the Google Play store. I usually have many multiple tabs open, expect it to operate like a full blown PC laptop and it generally does exactly what I want it to do. I watch videos, do photo editing, type thousands of words a day on it,  stream movies and create Google Docs, Slides and Sheets. I bought this to replace my three year old version of the same Chromebook because all of the letters were worn off the keyboard and some of the keys weren't working ... I'm actively using my Chromebook probably 8 or more hours a day so it would probably last even longer for most people. It's lightweight and fits easily in a tote or backpack. It holds up well. I use it sort of all day and night and I haven't found anything it won't do. The only place I notice this being slow is ironically when I open up Google Inbox and then I get to practice patience for a minute. Occasionally it will get sort of slow and then I'll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it. I handle a lot of images so the memory fills up a bit after a while. It comes with 100 gigs of free storage for two years from Google and I'm sold on Chromebook. I usually run it off home wi-fi but I can also tether it to my phone or use public wi-fi. The bluetooth connects easily to everything. The keyboard is nice. I type 100 wpm and I like the keyboard and touch pad a lot. The keys are responsive and quiet. It's a nice, clean, simple design and easy to keep clean. The only thing I wish Samsung would do is make a little indent where the power cord goes in to help guide the plug in because you kind of have to look when you're plugging it in. The power cord is super compact and is just the plug and cord with no big clunky thing on it. I've been able to find cloud based solutions for every piece of software I was using previously and I don't miss the PC at all since I went into the cloud in 2015. I really don't miss having to constantly update my system and all of the software. Google updates are super fast. You basically just restart and you're ready to go. It boots in seconds although I usually just leave it on constantly. I set my browser downloads to save to my Google Drive so there's no personal information stored on the Chromebook at all. It's under $200 and it's better than my $1200 PC laptop I replaced when I switched to Chromebook three years ago. It's absolutely silent. No fans grinding away. I sit with it in my lap all day long and it never gets hot. I don't play video games but I imagine that it would play cloud-based games fine. I've inadvertently had more than a dozen YouTube videos playing at the same time and it was sort of noisy but it wasn't lagging. And when you want to replace it, you just backup anything you've stored on the small hard drive and run the power wash on it. The only program I couldn't find a cloud solution for was Scrivener. But now you can get a virtual hard drive in the cloud for a fairly reasonable monthly rate and run any software you want on the Chromebook. It holds up to constant use and it's really sturdy despite being really slim and lightweight. The screen hinge is super strong and it's hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it.
153	tv	"This thing is great! I bought the 4GB model which will hopefully last me a few years but it's nice and snappy now. The 16GB of SSD storage is perfect as I use it for school and the biggest file I might be storing would be a picture. It integrates perfectly with my google account! This thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful. It's lightweight, has a long battery life and although it's smaller than a standard laptop, the keyboard is easy to use.Google and partners have done great with Chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate. There are multiple physical keyboard shortcuts running along the top of the keyboard to quickly adjust settings. There are also several different hotkey menus which are accessed by keyboard combinations.The only thing I'm bummed about is the lack of Google Play. I'm still giving this thing 5 stars because the Play store should be released soon as it is already available on other Chromebooks.I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable, easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet.UPDATE 7/21/17 - STILL ROCKSI've gotten more use out of this thing than I first envisioned. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and can easily access my Google Drive files that I create and edit on the Chromebook via Goggle Docs. It's still nice and snappy; I have Amazon Prime music running in one tab, working on a Google Docs file in another and browsing Reddit or searching something on a third tab and there's no hesitation. I've enabled the beta build and enjoy several Google Play Store applications. I added an SD card which has expanded on the 16GB of storage. I'm getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating Chrome. For instance: putting 2 finger tips on the touch pad and swiping left or right will act as the forward or back button. Also, ""clicking"" on a link by using 2 fingers and pressing on the touch pad, you bring up a menu to open in a new tab among other things. I watch Netflix and HBO Now and can definitely notice the lack of 1080p but it's a ""get what you pay for"" situation, and I knew that going in. This thing is still fantastic for what it is. If you want a proper laptop then buy one -- this is a Chromebook. I'll be back to give another update in a few months."
154	tv	Its fast and user friendly as all get out. I have a couple more expensive laptops with larger screens I purchased a few months before this one and I hardly ever touch those anymore. I have one set up in my  home office along with a desktop mainly for looks while the other functions as a guest laptop. But the Samsung stays with me. Haha. Im a Samsung phone user and android kinda fella and I reckon until they let me down...Ima be Sam Williams on Samsung for life!I don't know what separates  all the various Chromebooks but this one is perfect for someone who just wants to surf the net, watch Amazon Prime, and sync their photos to their laptop. Everything's quick fast and in a hurry on this guy. Great bargain!
155	tv	I recently purchased a Chromebook thru Amazon. The computer is slow and the cursor hardly moves. I didn’t order a refurbished computer but it appears this may be refurbished.
156	tv	"I have been using a Chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied.  I bought this This Samsung 11.6"" as a replacement for an older Chromebook that is showing its age a little.  For the price you can't beat a Chromebook.  I do 99% of my work on a Chromebook. Chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use.  I've gotten to where I despise Windows computers due to their bulk and all of the crashes and problems I've had over the years with Windows. My old Chromebook is an Acer and I've had absolutely no problems with it.  I chose to purchase a Samsung Chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( I paid $189.00).  To be honest, I like the feel of the Acer  keyboard a little better than this Samsung, but that's probably because I'm so used to the Acer. I've used the Acer so much that I've worn off the letters of several keys. This Samsung works as expected and is a good, basic Chromebook."
157	tv	I love this Chromebook!  The keyboard is easy to use, and there is no external noise to contend with.  All that was necessary for set up was turning it on and logging into google account, exactly as advertised!I use a computer, primarily for internet access and saving/posting photos.  It is fantastic for the things that I need a computer for.Defiantly well worth the money & then some.  I highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook for browsing the internet, and for note taking.I couldn't be happier with this product!
158	tv	XE500C13 versions:  S03US verses K03USThe K03US is exactly the same Chromebook as this S03US except it has twice the ram and twice the storage. Chrome OS rolling out July 2018 is said tor require more memory to handle new security processes. 4GB ram advised.The 4 gig K03US hit a low sub $140 price in Nov 2017 so I purchased one. Having given it constant heavy daily use since then doing research, typing, watching video and uploading photos it has had zero issues.  I give the XE500C13 ten stars for value reliability and performance at under $150 but not with 2GB of ram.  That's obsolete and why this S03US version only gets two stars from me.Hold out for a 4GB or better Chomebook if you can to avoid freeze-ups.  Would not hesitate to buy a used K03US if in eye appealing condition as there is little a user can do to damage these internally and will operate like new.XE500C13 PROS:  light weight highly transportable, decent water resistant keyboard, long battery life, fast recharging, sturdy construction for a low cost machine, micro SD card inserts flush to edge and can be left in all the time, silent, dependable, good wi-fi, opens 180 degrees, has blue light filter which user can set for night use.XE500C13 CONS: nothing serious:  The 12 volt 2.2 amp ac adapter, p/n AD-2612AUS, employs a needle-thin barrel power tip which is easily broken off and tends to fall out of the wall.  Replacement adapters are cheap though- have a spare on hand and consider getting an in-line type.  Display hinge is sturdy but too tight. low screen resolution as do all laptops at this price point, maximum sound level though built in stereo speakers may not at times be loud enough for some users, heats through bottom with heavy use,  touchpad is overly sensitive and can not be adjusted, at least on mine, this being the most annoying flaw.
159	tv	I have used this computer daily now for about 6 months, spending hours per day on it for an EMT/paramedic class. I haven't added any apps to it or done anything other than log into my online portion of school and complete lectures, so I can only speak for its basic tasks.It's extremely fast and has very little lag when opening pages or surfing the web.(*cough'Quizlet'cough*) I use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly, and it allows me access anywhere I have cell service. At school my cell service sucks so I have it set to automatically connect to Wi-Fi and it works great. The size is perfect, it's easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room. I use the Amazon basics sleeve to protect it, and use an electronic mouse to help perform tasks a little quicker. It's highly recommended that you purchase an SD card for this to store any documents etc., as it doesn't have large built in memory. I feel this computer is perfect for students who don't want to carry around a large laptop and add more weight to your already heavy backpack, but can still perform most of the same tasks as the larger ones and do the majority of school work you need to do. I highly recommend.
160	tv	"I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from ""Electro Express"" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly.  The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it.  No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True.  The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers.  Apple starts the warranty clock when ""they"" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty.  Long story short: the repair is $475 and ""Electro Express won't return my emails.  Buyer Beware!"
161	tv	For everyone taking advantage of this deal, I want to help you out with the warranty situation.If you buy this MacBook, your date of purchase will most likely be set to when Amazon received it, not when you bought it. There is a fix for this. Give Apple a call and request to speak to the department that can change the date of purchase. If you provide them your receipt from Amazon, they can change the date of purchase to when you bought it. This will make sure you get your one year warranty from the date you bought your MacBook Air.God bless.
162	tv	The box was sealed but i contact Apple to validate the MacBook purchase they tell me warranty don’t cover the 12 months because was not new and now i have only 189 days left of warranty from apple..  I pay for new i got something not brand new
163	tv	I was extremely hesitant to buy this MacBook Air because of the negative reviews about refurbished units, but I am so glad I did.  I received a BRAND NEW MacBook Air, exactly as described.  It was delivered in the original box and according to Apple, was a brand new unit.  It booted up without issue, ran smoothly and quietly, and worked perfectly when syncing to my iPhone and Apple Watch. I had no issues whatsoever and would recommend you take the leap and purchase this laptop without a second thought.
164	tv	This is exactly what I was looking for! I was really skeptical about ordering a new MacBook off of anything besides Apple or Best Buy but now I don’t regret one thing! The laptop came brand new wrapped by apple, which was nice to know! The laptop works very well and was in pristine condition!
165	tv	"Newest unopened box 2017 Macbook air at an amazing deal. I was a bit hesitant to order due to some of the reviews found amongst several amazon sellers and listings, but the deal was great, so I figured, why not. Besides, the cost is so low and zero tax charged in New York State, where my county is 8.75%, I saved a bundle. Just under $300.Shipping: The next day the order was showing up as delivery unavailable ""we'll email you with a date"" even with 2-day Prime, so I got an adjustment from Amazon for the trouble and was considering canceling all together. Turns out it arrived on time regardless and with no notification until an hour before delivery, call me surprised when it actually showed up on my doorstep. Besides that inventory hitch... an excellent purchase from the good deals seller.Packaging: The package arrived intact. The apple box itself is brand spanking new, with the slightest ding in it. Nothing to write home about.The housing seems legit to me, as a Mac owner of several types, what did seem off was the inside of the box seemed to have rips in it. Not a big deal. It is Chinese made after all. As far as I can tell this is brand new from the factory.Product: Came with high sierra 10.13.3 and I was able to update to 10.13.4 a few days later which significantly made it faster and more secure. As a product, its good enough but I prefer my desktop macs vs laptop macs anyhow. Lacking retina does not bother me at all and I can't even tell the difference from my IPS monitor on my custom mac mini. I do like that there isn't as much glare as with the retina. My friends and colleagues have some and on a sunny day, I get less glare distraction. The reason I purchased the air vs the macbook is the ports and the wider keyboard. This computer is wicked light and, had I gone with the smaller more expensive macbook 2017 gold, I would have felt cooler but ultimately been less productive. As a marketer for several businesses and a retired packaging designer. I really love the ease of use of the air. The keys could be a smidge bit smoother, in that the clicking causes a bit of strain on my hands. Nothing that can't be handled with a few more coffee breaks. And more significantly are the ports availability. I can air drop files back and forth or use google drive for the rest, so memory has yet to be an issue. In the even I find it a hassle, I found a few companies that will boost the drive with more flash memory if need be.All in all, wicked satisfied with this purchase."
166	tv	 Okay first off let me start by saying .... I AM AN AMAZON EMPLOYEE and used my employee discount on this product & my chase ultimate rewards points (if you are a chase sapphire credit card holder these points can be used) so I literally paid $500 for this MacBook which is a steal and I couldn’t pass this offer up. Secondly, like some other people have stated ... if you did not purchase your macbook from AMAZON DIRECTLY as the seller like I & some other people have done, then yes you may have gotten A used or refurbished MacBook, but if you bought the computer DIRECTLY from AMAZON then it should be brand new,  in the wrapper as if you bought this product from Apple directly. This MacBook is also a 2017 model so I would suggest before buying that you guys READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on a laptop that needs to be sent back. My laptop is under an original 1 year Apple limited warranty as all original Apple products are. I have the 90 day phone tech support warranty as well. I checked all of these on the Apple website. I also do have several Apple products ...... actually almost every Apple product there is and I’m only 28 which is kind of sad lol so I will say this .... GET THE APPLE CARE + on your products. Yes this is expensive, but if you’ve just invested several hundreds of dollars on something get it  warrantied because a MacBook can last you decades from now.-Now this is my personal opinion... if you guys don’t have the money to spend $500+ on a laptop because APPLE’S prices are way over rated , Then get a more reasonably priced product that fits your budget because even though I think it’s a great product & could use a few adjustments .....the price tag just isn’t here for everyone and I’m tired of people giving bad reviews on price when you can either return the product OR JUST DON’T buy it.-Also this MacBook comes with 128gb of storage so if you do a lot of video editing , photography editing etc then this laptop is not for you. You may want to look into getting a MacBook Pro with about 256gb is storage or more. If you do light video editing , browsing , school work etc then this laptop will work great for you. You guys will also have to download Catalina which is the latest software with MacOSIn conclusion buyers please don’t be scared off by the negative reviews because most of these people didn’t buy their laptops from AMAZON directly as the seller and more then likely went through a third party. From what I’m looking at also the people who brought their laptops from amazon directly got their laptop directly from Apple .....it just was not sold or shipped by them...... it was sold and shipped by amazon . Any who best of luck to you guys on your purchase ... I’m not getting paid for this review or anything like that. I did get a discount, but other than that I spent my hard earned $500 just like anyone else who shops on amazon. I hope this review helps
167	tv	This is my first Apple laptop and it is a good one. Seems  to last forever on the battery, quick and very functional.  A little while getting used to it (versus Windows), but all-in-all a great piece of machinery. I am very pleased with this purchase.
168	tv	Overall I am happy with this device with 1 issue.Im use to purchasing refurbished iPad's but always get my mac laptops and desktops new.. This time I decided the price for this unit was too good to pass up for a refurbished. So I decided to get it, to replace my old 2008 MacBook. Upon delivery, the corner of the Mac box was bashed a little, but there were no signs of damage on the unit overall.Sometimes you may get other labels over the original apple model number, which makes the device questionable. This wasn't the case here as everything looked like you just bought it from the Apple store. It boots up very fast, holds a charge very well and all ports, screen, camera, and audio work great. The reason 1 star is gone is because after 1.5 weeks of purchase with barely any use, the trackpad had failed. Luckily Apple is replacing it as we speak but itll take about 5 days to do so. Bummer. But overall it was in brand new condition. Worth the price.
169	tv	Do Not order.  I received a bracelet USB drive just like everyone else.  This is a SCAM.
170	tv	Fast and cheap. Better then Intel I3 and I5.
171	tv	Just started using it, but this seems like a very nice laptop that is compact and light enough to carry to classes on campus daily. Love the touch screen as well. Only issue is that the description lists this laptop as having a fingerprint reader, which is not true.
172	tv	I received the product with the alt key displaced and the shift and enter keys partially displaced. I also noticed that there is an abrasion below the shift and enter keys.
173	tv	this computer is so easy to set up  and doesn't heat up so I can place it on my legs while using..
174	tv	Me gusta mucho, es rápida, no genera mucho calor, la batería dura varias horas (como 4 horas para el uso que le doy, de manera activa). Soy programador de aplicaciones web, y ésta laptop verdaderamente no me deja nada que desear, puedo trabajar con Ubuntu 18 LTS tranquilamente, puedo trabajar con Visual Studio Code, tener varias pestañas abiertas en el navegador mientras programo y compilo, al mismo tiempo oír música en youtube, tener varias consolas abiertas trabajando con Node.js, y la laptop sigue siendo rápida. De verdad me ha gustado mucho.
175	tv	Just started using it, seems ok, fast, and responsive. Touch screen is accurate. Will update in coming weeks.
176	tv	Its great as in I gigs memory and higher than low end ssd. Needs enough to at least run op systems. This can. Just use your external drives. Only thing I wish is it was a quad core.
177	tv	I cannot use the computer because each time i use it. The computer gets freeze for a while and i cannot have this problem every time i do something on this computer. I do not know what to do to solve this. please help.
178	tv	It works!  It fired right up ad away we go.No problems so far. I like it ( except the weight )It’s heavy.
179	tv	The size and display is great but 2 of the USB ports were having issues and would repeatedly connect and disconnect whatever device was inserted here. Even plugging a charger in the phone would send messages saying “connected..disconnected..connected” back to back until I just unplugged the cord. Most likely will be Returning for this reason of USB ports not functioning properly. Had no other issues.
180	tv	"This is a great computer in many respects,  The specs of the computer are great and it is fast and snappy. The 512 GB SSD feels fast and speedy. The 16Gb of fast ram is nice. The i7 processor is a beast, with speed (and noisy fan) bursts when needed. This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside. The screen is nice and the 14 inch size is a nice compromise vs the larger 15.6 and 13 inch sizes.The chicklet keyboard is reasonable, and it is backlit which is a very nice touch. The fingerprint detector has been working reliably for me, but that isn't a feature that I care a lot about. I'm fine with logging into my computer with a PIN code or webcam.The Acer Spin 3 Convertible Laptop, 14"" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U, 16GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Backlit KB, Fingerprint Reader, SP314-53N-77AJ has a rechargeable active stylus, which is not - in my opinion - up to the task of doing artwork on a computer. It IS fine for note-taking and rough drawing, but for serious art-work I think it needs to be better. Still, it is definitely a nice touch.So what is my big beef with the Acer Spin 3? THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!. There is NO USB-C. If you aren't familiar with USB-C (I wasn't until recently) it is the connector of all connectors. A SINGLE USB-C can be used to add almost dozens of different devices to your computer. A $50 hub can be plugged into a USB-C port and it can support external hard drives, internet ports, HDMI output, headphone jacks, card readers and even charge other devices. A single small USB-C port makes your laptop able to connect to so many more devices. Without one, you limited in so many ways .The Acer Spin 3 comes with only a COUPLE of standard USB ports and a card reader, a headphone jack and an HDMI output. I am constantly trying to plug devices into my laptops and needing more ports, and the Acer Spin 3 just doesn't have many.Another interesting (good) thing about the Acer Spin 3 is that the wall wart or transformer for this computer is very small compared to most of my laptops. It is only 2.4 amps and about 45 watts, which isn't very much really. You could run this off of a good sized powerbank if you had to for a bit.I was torn on how to rank this on stars. On one hand, I am very disappointed in the limitations that the Acer 3 has on connectivity. On the other hand, it is a speedy little devil that is pretty competent at computing. If you are using this in a work environment where you need to do spreadsheets, e-mail, word processing and even photoshop type editing, it is a pretty nice machine with very respectable specs, speed and parts list. If you are looking for something super creative, where you can plug in several things like external hard drives, or drawing pads, or you want an awesome screen - you are going to be frustrated by the lack of USB-C.I'm going with four stars. It is a very good computer. But if it had even just one USB-C port, it would have been a great computer.I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too.I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP. Thank you for reading my review."
181	tv	I’ve used a lot of Mac and PC laptops in the past, and this particular model of the Spin 3 is my favorite for work so far.As a photographer and videographer, my work demands a lot of RAM and processing power, and that is where this PC excels. I can have Photoshop and Lightroom open at once, working back and forth between both programs, and the computer keeps up beautifully. The included rechargeable pen works with the full Adobe suite without any setup required — and it’s even pressure-sensitive! Extremely handy and natural feeling.The Spin 3 IS powerful enough to edit big projects in Premiere Pro, but after a certain point, some lag becomes inevitable. Still, I am surprised it handles large files as well as it does. I usually work with extremely large 4K videos formatted in ProRes CODEC, and the Spin handles them without any programs crashing.The downside of this PC, however, is its integrated graphics card. While cheaper and more energy-efficient, an integrated GPU is a great deal slower than a dedicated GPU when it comes to video editing, gaming, and other graphics-intensive tasks. So despite its fantastic processor and RAM, the Spin is just short of being the workstation it could be. The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I’ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot.However, despite its disadvantages, the Spin 3 remains powerful enough to work on the go, and if necessary, at least get a start on projects that can be finished on more powerful computers later. It features a beautiful touchscreen display, a good trackpad, an SD card reader, and a keyboard that feels pretty similar to older MacBooks. I would summarize it as a mid-level workstation — not quite as powerful as it could be, but more than adequate for dozens of professional tasks. I highly recommend it! There is not much to complain about.
182	tv	"Despite my first dismal experience with amazon’s shipping with the product arriving late and looking like it had been dropped kicked, my initial experience with the laptop.Speed: This boy is equipped with one of the fastest ssd’s available at a respectable size, 16gb of ram (a must in todays era), and a 4 core 8 thread processor. This cpu tends to score a 4787 on single threaded loads and a 13130 on multithreaded loads accourding to geekbench. ""Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance."" My particular machine scored a 5259 on the single threaded test and a 15849 on the multithreaded. It should also be considered that i had firefox running at the time of my tests which was utilizing around 5% of my cpu.The screen: the screen is beautiful and has amazing viewing angles as most ips panels, though when compared to my Pixio PX275H, which has a high color gambit, the colors did appear to be slightly more muted. The hinges are great when comparing it to a family members asus notebook that was bought earlier this year. Unlike the asus it doesnt lock up in odd orientations. The touch screen is responsive and the pen is adequate for light photoshop work. The pen does lack the capability for the finer details and the buttons on it lack any meaningful programability. The brightness is average. Not the brightest screen ive seen but certainly not the dullest. I used mine at about 40% in a well lit room and 60-70% in a sunlit room.Battery life: at a balanced setting and an average use case this will last about 6 hours. This time can be increased if you use the optimal battery saving options and set the gpu to prioritize battery life when the system is unplugged.The keyboard and touchpad: this keyboard feels amazing! Its nice and solid and the keys are firm and dont wiggle. The backlight is nice and crisp—but not over bearing—and can be turned off. The touch pad is large and responsive and handles all the gestures excellently. The finger scanner is just as fast as touch id on my iphone 6s which is nice.The io: only 2 usbs? Not even a type c? Why acer! It would be more acceptable if both usbs were 3.1 but one of the usbs is a 2.0 which has way slower speeds. (When compared to its 10gbps 3.1 brethren) That port is basically only useful for a mouse dongle. It does have a sd card reader which is nice, but it juts out too far in my opinion. It could have easily been designed to fit more snugly into the system upon viewing the interior of the system. The full size hdmi is a plus and the powerbrick for the laptop is super small. The power connector also swivels for optimal placement.Gaming: this is not a gaming machine. This machine shines brightest in its productivity workloads. The integrated graphics should be able to run most competitive games like rocket league, csgo, fortnite, and overwatch at low to medium settings. It can run minecraft with optifine at around 50fps on average with a beefy texture pack.Upgradability: the laptop is equipped with 8gb of ram soldered to the board and an 8gb stick of ddr4 ram. Acer has confirmed that this motherboard can utilize 24gb if you were to swap that 8gb stick for a 16gb. The NVME drive is relatively easy to access and swap out for a 1tb if you so wish. Theoretically you could also try adding a 2.5in drive as there is an empty bay for it. If you were to do that you would need to acquire a ribbon cable connector. I have tried one from an SP315 model with no success, but that may be due to a defective wire. I currently have ordered a cable from an SP314 model to see if i have any luck with that. I will update if im successful.I got my system on prime day for $100 off, but even at its full $800 price tag this system is tempting. You wont find all these features on another laptop at this price point. The closest thing i could find was an ultrathin at the same price by acer, but it had only 8gb of ram and no touchscreen and pen support. I would recommend this pc for your average user. Pretty much anyone that doesnt intend to do any heavy gaming or professional color focused work."
183	tv	"I was a bit hesitant to buy based on all the ""bought"" Vine reviews. But the great price n specs I couldn't pass up. Very fast and has a beautiful and responsive touch screen. The Ad says 12 hour battery life but it only lasts 6 hours so can't give it 5 stars. And the fingerprint reader didn't work well for me so I just use a pin to login. Seems well built and very light. The fan noise is average. Pleased with this purchase."
184	tv	"Generally the laptop is good. In price-to-performance and characterstics criteria I found it best. Runs fast, no lags. I would give 5 stars if not the following issues:- The most annoying is that enter key stucks sometimes, and comes out in 1-2 seconds or doesn't come out. I hope engineers will improve that in later versions.- Touch screen works well, but I expected it to be wider. As it can be observed from the photo it is not as wide near to bottom where ""acer"" is written.- Also battery life is written up to 12 hours. But in my case it not more that 8 hours."
185	tv	"UPDATE: a few months in and I'm overall pretty happy with this laptop. A metal body would be nice (this one shows smudges and recently got a scratch although I'm not sure how since the lid was shut and the scratch was by the touchpad). I have yet to need it for anything particularly resource intensive but no issues using it for Word, PDFs, Internet, and the like. It's also not all that common that I hear it's fans go into overdrive and make a ruckus. I try to use a lap desk whenever I'm not at a desk but even when I don't, it hasn't gotten as hot as the first day when it was too hot to leave on my lap. In short, if my previous cons list had led me to only give 4 stars, I would bump it up to a 5 now, but it was a five-star purchase from the start. :)(Summary at the bottom)PROS:-This is a pretty reasonable deal when you compare to the cost of getting the same specs on other laptops. I was mainly looking at Dell and Lenovo and the best I found from them was Lenovo's 2019 Flex 6 14"". Biggest difference between the specs that mattered to me was the Lenovo only cost $750 but also only had an i5 processor. The specs that mattered to me were processor, hard drive capacity, SSD, screen resolution, size, weight, RAM, and that it was a 2-in-1.-I haven't used much more than Chrome, Adobe PDF reader and Excel yet so I haven't tried to max out computer resources but I can verify that there's no lag with normal use. Restart takes 20 seconds from hitting restart to being logged in with the fingerprint scanner.-3rd party reviews from sites like PCMag of the 2018 model complained about the keys not depressing far enough to be comfortable typing a lot. While a slightly longer keystroke would feel more satisfactory to me, it's not so shallow that I would avoid it for large quantities of writing.-FHD seems like a good resolution on a 14"" screen. HD is not considered high res these days but I doubt the improvement of a 4K screen would be worth the cost, if you could even notice a significant difference between the two screens.-My last laptop had a 15.6"" screen so it was a bit of a risk cutting down on screen space but 14"" doesn't feel cramped the way 11"" or even 13"" does. It doesn't feel small unless it's sitting right next to my old laptop. The weight savings of having a smaller laptop are definitely worth it!-It's got a plastic body but it doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply built for the most part. The few minor exceptions are in my Cons list.-Fingerprint scanner was a bonus for me. It works very nicely-Stylus is handy in tablet mode. I didn't buy the laptop for the stylus so I can't speak to it's quality but I was able to make some fun art messing around in Inkscape with it. I don't know how it would work for professional-level art since the limiting factor for me is that I'm still pretty new to Inkscape.CONS:-Doesn't have the 12-hour battery life they advertise but then again, what laptop ever has the full capacity advertised? I would guess it's actually around 6-8 hours, which is still pretty reasonable. Tip: look up Acer's recommendations for battery charging before you set it up. I know it's important to go through a few full charge cycles when you first get it to extend the battery life but I forget the details of their recommendation.-It does get hot and use the fans at full speed pretty easily. The vents are on the bottom of the laptop and along the hinged edge whereas my last laptop had them on the left edge so with this one, I can almost guarantee you'll want to set it on a lap desk or large book rather than directly on your lap if you're going to be using it for a longer sitting. I'll probably eventually get a lap desk with cooling fans built in. That said, there's only been a couple times the fans have gotten noisy when it wasn't on my lap and when I moved it off my lap after it got too hot to be comfortable, it cooled down very quickly.-The charging plug is surprising small - probably to help keep the laptop thin. I don't mind that but it still has a lot of wobble to it when it's plugged in so my preference is to unplug it again once the battery is fully charged.-Indoors with a room well-lit by ambient daylight, having the brightness at about 65% is comfortable for me. This doesn't leave a lot of buffer to amp it up outside in the sun but I'm not surprised that's not what laptops are designed for.-Same with the volume - max volume was comfortable if not a bit quiet outdoors but if I wanted to broadcast music outside, I'd use a portable speaker anyways. In the home, I haven't felt the need to max out the volume though.-There's a couple rubber feet and you can see some of the places the screen clips into the frame, which gives it a bit cheaper aesthetic but nothing major. I'll probably get used to it.-Bezel along the top and sides is reasonable but it's pretty thick along the bottom - probably 3/4"" of visible case, which makes sense because of the hinges, but then another 1""+ of glossy black before the screen actually starts. The only thing in that space, at least externally, is the Acer logo. The result is it makes the task bar look really far up.-Probably the thing I dislike the most is that the casing used for the 360 hinges has a see-your-reflection-in-it type of shiny surface. Maybe it's just personal taste but it makes them look like cheap plastic. It's also annoying when I'm in a room with low lighting and they catch the glare from a lamp behind me.SUMMARY:It has some quirks I don't care for but I bought it mainly for the processing power and portability. More money would probably fix the quirks but thanks to other reviews, I wasn't surprised by any of them."
186	tv	I just got this laptop and I gotta say, It delivers. It is fast and runs my applications like PyCharm, Anaconda and Autodesk Inventor pretty well so far. The only issue I have so far is how loud the fan is. Especially when you're transitioning from a virtually noiseless laptop. Besides that, It is a great product and I recommend!
187	tv	I was surprised by the actual power this thing had. The touch screen is very responsive and the finger print reader doesnt miss a beat. This computer boots and logs in in less than 5 seconds with the finger print reader. The only complaint I have is that it feels a little flimsy so you will need to use it with a bit more caution. I will be looking for a hard case for transporting it to class. This thing should definitely do everything a college student will need it to.Update:About a month in and it's still pretty quick. It's slowed down maybe a little with some of the programs I've been adding and running. I have the drive set to defragment everyday so that helps. I am still pretty well happy with it. I do wish it were a little more sterdy. They plastic bows quite a bit and it makes me nervous transporting it as often as I do for college. Wish they made a hard shell case for this.
188	tv	Do not buy this computer... it has been one of my worse experiences with any laptop by various reasons.First of all, when they sent the computer and a letter of they keyboard didnt work. After concluding that it wouldnt get any better I called customer service for them to fix it. They responded warmly and willingly to help, nevertheless, after I sent it, it was returned with the charger missing! To this day I cant use the computer because I need to buy a new generic charger. The worse part was that they didnt fix the computer well! Now a part of the touchpad doesnt work correctly. Another thing to take into consideration is that the touchscreen is made out of a cheap material, therefore it bends with little effort.Overall it is a good computer, however in case it isnt delivered to you in perfect conditions, I would suggest you to ask for a refund, because if you send it for repair it may come back with the charger stolen or another part of the laptop malfunctioning.
189	tv	"I bought a laptop Acer Spin 3 (Convertible Laptop, 14"" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U) when it was on sale (Photo 1). We found there was a gap on the left side between top and bottom, which was clearly seen by zooming in the photo. We returned it to exchange another one.Soon after we set up the second one (photo 2 for illustration), we heard a rattling and colliding sound of the fan when the laptop was lifted up with hands holding top-left and bottom-right corners. The same sound could be heard when the speaker was slightly pressed near “SPIN” with a finger or when an ear pressed against the cover (when closed). This is NOT the normal noise of the fan. It is a defect. The fan and/or the parts it hits and even the whole computer could soon break.I requested a return and I selected ""Item Defective OR doesn't work"" as the reason for return (within a few days of delivery). The the seller charged me $139.80.According to the return policy for ""Computers and Electronics"" and listed reasons for return, have could charge the return of a DEFECTIVE computer (or any product)??!!(This is NOT the end of our complaint!)"
190	tv	 I had originally purchased a similar tablet for $999 from my cell phone carrier but returned it after I purchased this Windows tablet.  The reviews for the one from the phone carrier were terrible, the screen was smaller and had less RAM.  I was very delighted to come across this XIDU tablet on Amazon.  I immediately purchased it and received it 2 days later.  The keyboard is amazingly light, functional and sturdy.  The tablet itself is very well built and sturdy.  The battery life is amazing.  I switched it from Windows S mode to Windows home upon receiving and am very happy with the speed.  Very happy with my purchase and you will be as well!***UPDATE 9/5/2019***The laptop has been malfunctioning and will intermediately have a full screen flicker.  Video uploaded.***UPDATE 9/10/2019***The customer service team is really attentive and really wants to make sure you’re taken care of.
191	tv	Tablet works great. Upgrade it to Windows 10 home full version for free from the windows store right away. Then download all updates for windows 10 in the check for updates section repeatedly a few times, updating will take all day literally hours and hours it is not frozen just slow..... Once this is done you can turn off automatic brightness control in the display settings and have a very bright screen that NEVER dims!  SUPER BRIGHT, better then my laptop screen now.Besides that you may want to go into ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS and CLICK, PERFORMANCE SETTINGS and change it to Adjust for BEST PERFORMANCE since this tablet is as powerful as a netbook you don't want performance wasted on windows appearance.SD CARD slot on the back accepted my 400gb SD card, dont bother buying a fast SD card because the built in card reader is slow.And the bluetooth surface mouse works great with this tablet, my wife is happy after i changed the settings and updated everything.  Its been working nicely for her work and school needs.
192	tv	Better than a surface! It runs faster, and has all the same capabilities. Tech support is awesome and responds quickly. Everything you need (and possibly a few surprises) come in the package. Screen protector is thin but Mac book screen protector should fit if you want something better. Pen takes a AAAA battery, not AAA. Love the keyboard is wireless and not a Bluetooth. A little bigger than most 2 in 1’s but still light weight and fits in a book sack/ computer case.
193	tv	Perfect budget laptop/2 in 1, sharp quality, but may be wider than you'd expect. Pen works great for me, but button placement is a little hard to get used to. The charger that comes with is a little bulky and thinking about getting a replacement charger with same voltage/amperage. Screen protector comes included but I totally failed at putting it on. Battery life lasts as expected from the advertisement. My one complaint was mostly Windows related, I thought the screen dimming on this laptop was busted but it turns out you need to update to Windows 1903 to turn off adaptive brightness which the tablet doesn't seem to support.
194	tv	"The screen was to wide for me and it was also to short.  The screen color was acceptable but it does not look as good as the Surface 6 Pro or the Surface Book 2. Using it as a tablet, it was a bit heavy and awkward because of it length. It arrived with a bent part of the frame above one of the USB ports. I had two USB flash drives that could not be inserted into the ports.  The USB C port was not a very tight connection. I also noticed the case was also bent in where the keyboard attached. It was noticed this when I was about to attach the screen to the keyboard. I did not find the touch screen to be that sensitive and the screen kept dimming on me. The keyboard was OK. I was impressed with the speed of the processor.  This was purchased based on the reviews and the price. In the end after using it for about 3 days, I was displeased with the the computer and have returned it for a refund. If the screen of this Phil Pad (11½"" x 6½"") was about the size of a Surface 6 Pro (10¼"" x 7"") or the Surface Book 2 (11"" X 7½""), I would have kept it. I will now save my money and eventually get a Surface."
195	tv	I had very mixed feelings writing this review, here is why:The bad first:I had to buy and return several Philpads to get one that worked properly. This could have just been bad luck on my part since many other reviews here are saying it works fine. But the Function key for brightness was a particular problem on more than one and the USB-C port didn't transmit data on one of them too. So I'm a little suspect about the hardware.That being said, now the good:I will simply say this, for this price point you are not going to find a 2 in 1 tablet like this, period. Believe me, I looked all over Amazon and the web. This is basically a Surface Pro at 1/3 to 1/2 the price depending on the model, you aren't going to beat that. It uses the same form factor and unlike Surface Pro you don't have to pay $100 extra for a separate keyboard!I went through so much trouble returning several of these because I like this laptop that much. Also, their customer support is excellent and highly responsive. Even with all the problems I had they were helping to resolve even sending me software to reinstall OS and offering to troubleshoot each problem with screenshots and one of their techs. Lastly, brightness control is a Windows 10 Update not a Xidu problem (unless the function key is broken) and can be fixed by disabling the Ambient Light Sensor in Device Manager. The screen brightness will work fine after that and it is -very- bright once you disable it.
196	tv	For its price, this XIDU PhilPad is really great. It's sleek design is lovely and its 2K resolution is pretty crazy at this price. The combination of a touchscreen, stylus, resolution, tablet, and design makes it one of the better 2 in 1s I've seen. Not only that but the customer service is just as lovely. Although I say this, it did have a few performance issues. If you're looking for a budget laptop this is a great option. If you're looking for more than that, try something else.
197	tv	"I am so happy that I ordered this laptop. Even on battery in most battery saving mode (5+ hrs), the 13"" screen display is beautiful, bright, and clear and stands securely. keyboard is detachable and has a great touch. Good speakers. The packaging was impressive, sturdy, protective, white box as if designed to hold a work of art. Came with a nice unexpected gift. Whole thing is metal, well-built, sturdy, beautiful."
198	tv	 This is an excellent 2 in 1 for the price. It comes with Windows S mode, which is easily converted to standard home via the Microsoft marketplace for free. Search google for this process; it's very simple. It comes with Intel HD Graphics 505 for anyone curious about that. If you want to play older games, it should be able to handle some. I'll break down some of the key Pro's and Con's here.Pros:- No bloatware.- good speed, no slowness for general use.- The kickstand is easy to use.- IPS screen looks great. It has great viewing angles you would expect from an IPS Screen.- Full HD.- Fast charging USB C.- Great battery life.- Great keyboard and trackpad- Premium feel and material.- Keyboard protector and extra screen protector included.Cons- Pen uses AAAA (4) batties, which I didn't even know existed. I haven't been able to test the pen yet as I wait for batteries. (UPDATE: The pen works great)- Wished it came with 8gb ramIf you're looking for a decent ultraportable laptop for school or general day to day stuff, this is the way to go without spending a considerable amount. I'll update my review as needed if we run into issues. So far, so good!
199	tv	Sincerely,This tablet is the best.And the price is also very friendly.Now I don't have a reason not to take my laptop to work, it is light.I am giving this machine 10 stars
200	tv	On the XIDU 14.1, 2-in-1 LaptopThe best of both worlds between a desire for a tablet and a desire for a laptop comes with the purchase of a 2-in-1 laptop. That way, you get the best of both! An example would include the touch screen feature of the tablet and the memory/keyboard feature of the laptop. The XIDU Philbook Max, 14.1 inch, 2in1 is one such unit to consider.1. It's compact with its 14.1-inch screen, weighing only 3.1 lbs. and will nicely fit in a shoulder bag.2. It's not expensive, less than $400.3. It comes with Windows 10, a full-fledged operating system and not the Chromebook operating system (where most applications don’t reside on the unit itself but via the “cloud”.) as many of the cheaper notebooks have.4. It comes with a beautiful screen with a higher than average resolution of 1920 x 1080 (average is 1366 x 768 screens).5. The XIDU MAX provides 5 -6 hours of convenient battery power, good for the road traveler who doesn't always have an available connection.6. Its build quality is solid, having its body made of an aluminum alloy.7. It comes with a backlit keyboard, a great convenience when the surrounding light is not the best.As 2-in-1 models go, you have 3 modes that you can perform:1 Tent mode; great for a limited space. (Pic1)2 Tablet mode (full 360-degree flip!), especially useful for reading, game-playing, and music listening. (Pic2)3. and Laptop mode, the most useful, especially when performing keyboard input. (Pic 3)With its dual-core Processor with 6GB RAM working power and 128GB storage capability (many provide 64GB options), you will have ample power to cover your everyday uses, such as web surfing and streaming, email, word processing, gaming, and spreadsheets for business. To augment your storage capacity, you will have the pleasure of using the installed micro SD slot, where you can easily double your storage capacity. When it comes to major gaming and video editing, a more powerful laptop at a higher cost would provide better results. This is not saying that there are not games that can be played and picture editing that cannot be done.Among other “ports”, including the micro SD reader are:(Left – Right) ON/off switch, 1x Micro SD Card Reader,1x USB 3.0, 1x Headphone jack (Pic. 4)(Left – Right) Power Jack, 1x Mini HDMI, 1x USB 3.0,Also, it comes with Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Dual Band 2.4GHz/5.0GHz, good for those with dual-band routers. (Pic 5)What I like: A beautiful, snazzy unit that you will proudly carry anywhere.  The Wi-Fi 802.11ac along with the internal processing power gives me a smooth performance. It’s a lightweight (3.1 lbs.)  for a 14-inch unit, yet it’s a heavyweight providing easier reading and more life-like games with its large screen.What I would prefer: Although not essential, a longer battery performance would be nice.Finally, the lasting value of any computer is to have a support staff to pull you through those temperamental rough sports that occur from time to time. As for the XIDU staff, my personal experience is that when you reach out to them, they will reach out to you. A simple email to them will be rewarded with a helpful quick response.I just say, check it out for yourself. You won’t be sorry you did! I highly recommend the XIDU Philbook MAX, 14.1, 2-in-1!
201	tv	"3 important factors for me are the screen resolution, RAM and drive capacity.  Many of the ""budget"" brands skimp on these.  Xidu packs a lot in for the price.Someone else did a great review, so I won't rehash that.Small things of note:I wish the RAM was 8GBScreen brightness could use a boostThis unit has some heft to it, does not have that cheap-light-plasticy feel.I am very happy with the Philbook so far and will be deploying it to my user next week for testing in the field.Additional comment added 6/15/2019:  I forgot to mention, the surface of the keyboard, palmrest and touchpad are great because they are NOT fingerprint magnets."
202	tv	Wow I'm honestly surprised how good this thing is. It's my first time ever buying a laptop and this one really satisfied me. The build is awesome made me feel like I was using a premium device And the hand touch is not bad at all. I also received a gift card from them 😁 highly recommend the PhilBook max
203	tv	I am particularly impressed with the build quality and the attention to little details; such as pads for the screen and chassis when closing the laptop. The aluminum body is sleek, lightweight, and well built. The hinges have just enough flexibility to easily convert from laptop to tablet mode. The touch screen works flawlessly and the keyboard is comfortable and responsive. The boot time is fast due to the SSD hard drive, and the 6GB of RAM provides for a very responsive experience when working with multiple windows and apps. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. One last thing - it has none of the crapware other major brands have preinstalled...
204	tv	Have had this tablet for a week, love it. It's light and easy to navigate. Battery life is great. Purchased this for my wife, who is a computer novice; she loves it. Sher has had no difficulties using it, in fact she commented on how she liked it more than previous tablets we have had in the past. Would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a tablet. Thanks Xidu.
205	tv	I've only just received it, so there is a lot to explore.  It is nice to have the combination and features of a tablet and laptop. It is lightweight yet seems to have a quality build.  I like the touchscreen.  I am thankful that Xidu is sending me a mouse because I am terrible with pads.I have not figured out Cortana yet. She keeps wanting to search for movies
206	tv	I like the product has a lot of different features within the price the memory isn’t bad it’s a thin laptop comes brand new tablet version or laptop version it’s windows cortona loves to talk to you but it makes it easy lol. The Brand I had never heard of but it’s worth every penny
207	tv	This little touchscreen laptop gives you a huge bang for your buck. It includes so many desirable features, including a wonderful back lit keyboard. The processor speed could be faster, but for the price it's more than adequate for my needs in a second computer. Thank you baohuazhong for offering such a wonderful bargain to consumers. I hope your company is successful and continues to grow.
208	tv	I really didn't get much of a chance to use it. The touch screen was very responsive, even with the protective screen film  still on. This is a great laptop for the price. Other comparable laptops I had looked at all cost at least $150 more and many didn't even have all the features this LT has. My wife grabbed it the day after the laptop arrived and has claimed it as hers. She says it is great and told me if I want one I should buy my own.
209	tv	Very nice little laptop for a very good price. The processor is a bit slow but it works for my home needs. It is thin, slick, and light so I can carry it in my bag. It has very crisp graphics. Overall, a nice product. Also, very responsive customer support.
210	tv	I am a Project Manager and during my last assignment the company provided this LG gram laptop.  I fell in love with it.  When the project ended, I had to turn it back in to the company.  So went to Amazon and found my baby.  I brought it.With the SSD drive, it boots up like an iPad.  For all these years I would complain about Windows being slow.  But now see it was the hardware.  Next, it is so light.  I love just carrying it from my desk to a meeting to take notes or minutes.Light weight and super fast and thin.  I only got the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB drive. Would have liked the 16 GB RAM and bigger drive but wanted to keep the price down. you can go crazy with add ons. After all I have 5 other PC's at home already (3 Apple & 2 Windows).Now for the semi bad part. I got the LG Gram laptop all set up with Office, Outlook, OneDrive, my special software loaded etc.. and noticed some web pages were slow to down load.  Checked my speed and it was bad.  I got .6 mbps download and 12 mbps upload.  Yes, that is correct the download was poor. barely moving.  I checked all drivers were up to date. I rebooted my modem, router, changed networks, compared with my other PC's and they all were fine.  175 to 280 mpbs download.  All signs to me was the hardware was defective.  I had only had the new laptop for 2 days. I was ready to return it. !!!A friend came over, I complained to him. He suggested it was a driver problem.  I showed him all drivers were up to date. Then he noticed the wifi adapter was made by Intel (wifi 9560) BUT the driver was from Microsoft.  He said lets see if Intel has a driver.  Sure enough they did. we installed it and the problem was fixed.Wow, I was so relieved.  I really did not want to send it back. I loved it. Now my wifi is working just fine.
211	tv	I used to have Acer swift 5 laptop. So, I can compare this with Acer.Pros:1. Battery life: Around 10 hours of keeping play videos like watching movies or intensive work. Normal document work on and off can last  around 17 hours. Idling with display on may last for 28 hours. (new update: keep working on MS office and it lasts around 10 hours.)2. Super light weight and big screen of course. ( I also got a rechargeable blue tooth mouse to save a USB port.)3. Micro SD card slot: I love it. Acer swift 5 uses SD card with half of the card exposed outside, making it easy to bend. This LG used micro SD and most of the card in the laptop. I now used 512GB micro SD card as the drive. I can bring the card away with me for the important data.4. Read/Write speed up to 87 MB/s for big file transfer among SSD, micro SD, and USB3.0 card reader. The card reader was tested around 100MB/s on Acer swift 5.5. easy to setup with rechargeable bluetooth mouse.6. support up to 2TB micro SD card for future expansion.7. 3x USB3.0 + 1x type C USB3.0 are powerful enough to drive those WD and Seagate derive at the same time. I am not sure about USB3.1. However, I have 4 of them connected and only transferring data with 2 HDD drives.Cons:1. Response a little bit slower than Acer swift 5. But still can take it. (I turned down real-time security things. Anyway, I usually behind a gateway firewall)2. Audio effect is not good without earphone, much worse than Acer swift 5. High pitch sounds like locked inside the computer. This is basically not for entertainment. Earphone or external speakers are recommended. The win 10 even has no equalizer for me to fix sound effects.3. A little bit glare of video playback, not top quality, worst than Acer swift 5.4. If fan is triggered on, it generates more heat and it seems getting into dead loop of keep cooling down. It ends up with making it shorter battery time. Dimming the screen is a better option so that the PC stay longer for 1 full charge and avoiding fan triggered.Conclusion: This is very good for business travel and documentation work, not recommended for gaming or entertainment.
212	tv	The laptop is everything I hoped it would be.  Amazing battery, super light, yet feels totally sturdy.I bought it used from Amazon (loved the discount), but the LG Control Center was missing when I got the machine, and it's been awful trying to get the download link from LG.Also having a hard time getting the specs for upgrades to RAM and to add a second SSD.  I bought this specific model because they advertise that it's upgradeable, but I can't find a hint of what the specs are for the RAM upgrade or what SSD to add.I guess I'll keep trying to find a support tech who knows the answers, but it sure would be nice if it didn't take so many attempts.I would absolutely recommend this laptop (and I already have).  Just make sure you are plenty patient if you need support.
213	tv	Outright false advertising on the battery life.  With screen turned all the way down and minimal browsing I'm lucky to get 6 or 7 hours on this thing, a far cry from what is advertised.  When it says I have 1hr45m left, it'll shut down 30 min later with a dead battery.Screen is also not very bright, not fit for outdoor use, but it also won't let you dim it down a ton either, it's too bright at its lowest setting for use during dark lectures and the like.This thing is a misfit that only excels at being light weight, and at nothing else.  Others do this just as well, but have better processors, or brighter screens, or more dimmable screens, etc.I'll hang on to it, but I won't buy it again, nor recommend that others buy it.
214	tv	Used it for only a day(seriously), haven't installed anything other than google chrome and skype. Next day started having problems waking from sleep, then a hour later progressed to not being able to shut down properly at all. Then later that night, couldn't even boot Windows at all, can't even get into BIOS. Terrible terrible quality. So sad now that I made this purchase. Should've stayed with Lenovo or Dell. Heed my warning!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS
215	tv	I am the managing partner of a law firm I started 22 years ago.  Over that period of time I have never had a better laptop than the LG Gram 15.  My comments are anecdotal so please don't expect a technical review.  I purchased the 8th generation i5 version and it is a delight.  Startup with Windows 10 is no more than 15 seconds and it moves my word processor, quick books, and outlook effortlessly.  The battery life is amazing allowing me to spend the whole afternoons without a plug-in.  I use this for work so cannot comment on graphics for games.  But this machine has eliminated the frustrations I had with the long lead times and sluggish response of my prior Dell 17inch.  Also, I love the sizing of the machine to screen.  The 15 inch screen works for me as well as my prior 17 inch.  Finally, I must applaud  the size and weight of the laptop.  It is like carrying my old ipad from years ago - what a treat.  Strongly recommend this product for anyone looking for a productive work laptop.
216	tv	I was looking for an all-around laptop that I can use at home as well as Starbucks and other places.  I hate big and heavy laptops.  I know about LG's light-weight laptops from some years back, so I gave it a shot.  Since day one til now I absolutely love it.  It's so light-weight I love carrying it around everywhere I go.  Its screen brightness makes working on it a pleasure.  Battery life is great, under normal usage it can last me 2-3 days before I have to charge it.  There are other ultrabooks out there but so far, this one is the winner for me.
217	tv	This is our first laptop and first exposure to Windows 10 - big improvement.  Speed is much better also.
218	tv	Muy ligera, es fácil de transportar. Parece tener buena velocidad, aunque solo la he utilizado para editar fotos con adobe lightroom.
219	tv	Esta bien apenas la voy a conocer pero me parece muy ligera y avanzada tecnología
220	tv	"This is an upgraded version of the ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21. I own both (my son inherited my SA). Great notebook for the money! There really is not much to not like about this notebook.The upgrades I can find on this notebook over the ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21 are the N4200 processor, upgraded ac wireless card (AC 7265), and fingerprint sensor. The NA uses the Apollo Lake chipset and the SA uses the Braswell chipset. Using AIDA64 I compared components on the newer NA to older SA version and many of the components are the same. They use the same 128 GB eMMC drive (SanDisk DF4128), same screen (INNOLUX N140HGE-EAA), and same ram (Micron). The N4200 processor in the NA does significantly increase performance over the N3700 in the SA version of notebook. The N4200 was introduced about 17 months after N3700. The base speed of the N4200 is 1.1 GHz vs. 1.6 GHz of the N3700. This a good thing because it consumes less energy when running at lowest speed. The Turbo speed of the N4200 is 2.5 GHz while the N3700 is 2.4 GHz. The GPU in the N4200 also varies frequency from 200 - 750 MHz while the N3700 GPU varies frequency from 400 - 700 MHz. The GPU on the N4200 also upgrades execution units to 18 over the 16 on the N3700. When looking at benchmarks of these CPUs at CPUBoss and CPUmonkey the performance is significantly better with the N4200. Geekbench 3 multi-core score with N4200 was 72% higher than N3700. Cinebench R11.5 GPU score was 86% higher on N4200. Real world experience using both side by side is that the newer NA performs significantly better than the SA.Pros:* Very nice design. Stylish.* Great physical size and weight. Nicely thin and weighs about what some lighter 13"" notebooks weigh.* Very good build quality. Nice aluminum lid and notebook feels solid.* Fingerprint sensor is a nice addition.* 1080p screen. Not a fantastic screen but much better than many other budget notebooks.* Boots significantly faster than older SA version. I'm not sure why this is the case given how similar hardware is but it is true. Optimized bios?* Decent graphical performance. 1080p h265 movies run great and look very nice. Gaming at native resolution is possible with some older games with middle settings. Games tried include: Company of Heroes, Half-Life 2 Update, Bioshock, and Portal 2. I was averaging about 30 fps with these games at 1920x1080. Gaming performance with newer NA version is better than older SA version.* Excellent keyboard. This one is huge. This notebook has minimal flex in keyboard and is very nice to type on.* Great touchpad and buttons. Much nicer than expected with notebook at this price.* Amazing battery life. This really is an all day notebook. Best battery life of any notebook I have ever owned. Battery time on this new version is better than the older ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21.* Very nice performance. Solid multitasking performance with no lag or stuttering. The Pentium N4200, 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB eMMC drive combine to give notebook solid performance.* Excellent Wifi and Bluetooth performance. Having dual band wireless with AC is also a plus. This notebook utilizes an Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7265 which is another component that is impressive on budget notebook. I get very good range and speeds with the notebook. The AC 7265 is an upgrade over the SA's AC 7260. One of the upgrades is bluetooth version 4.2 over the 4.0 in the AC7260.* Type-C port (with charging).* SD slot (though not deep enough for regular SD card). I'm using the BASEQI Low Profile Micro SD Adapter for Raspberry Pi with a 128gb micro SD card and it works great. This adapter protrudes about 1 mm out of notebook and can be left in at all times with no issues. I put movies and programs on this card to save space on eMMC drive. Programs/games installed on adapter/micro SD card work well (I do have quality fast micro SD card though).Cons:* The new N4200 CPU and Apollo Lake chipset is capable of faster ram speeds (up to 2400 MHz) and using DDR4 memory but they kept DDR3 ram and speed is still at 1600 MHz.* Not the best viewing angles on screen.* .3 megapixel webcam.I'm not really clear on why the older SA version appears to be selling at a higher price than the newer NA version. Apparently people do not know there is a newer and better version out there :)"
221	tv	So, the laptop looks great in black and includes a fast-charging adapter.USB type-c is a great upgrade for modern electronics. Speakers are really good but the screen is not on the brighter side.Comes with preloaded Microsoft office for 1year additionally the battery lasts up to 9hrs.Overall it is better than my Chromebook.
222	tv	Great little device. Best specs for the price range. Love the fingerprint unlock, range of ports and battery life. It would have been nice to have a USB-C charger rather than a dedicated charging port, but hey, that’s a pretty minor issue. Excellent resolution screen, keyboard key return and trackpad. Highly recommended
223	tv	Bought for son for college. Feels kinda cheap, but it works. Internet is good on it, but we have slow internet so it'll prove itself once he's on campus. It's a shiny white, easy to get dirty. White everywhere. So not for dirty fingers. I've instructed him to wash his hands. Also, Amazon did a bad job packaging it. Hopefully it works for the next 4 years. It does come with 1 year office product! That was the highlight.
224	tv	It's been about 2 months since I've ordered this and I'm pleasently satisfied. I strongly suggest that you remove it from S Mode. When it was activated Microsoft edge was SLOW! sloooww! It made me think the laptop was crap but once I left s mode and installed Chrome, everything worked perfectly.PROS:• Can run Sims 3 (it runs sims3 pretty well, the graphics aren't bad and there hasn't been any crashes. It doesn't get hot. I can play for about 3hrs before the battery nearly dies)• Very lightweight•The white is so sleek and pretty (peep my stickers)CONS:•The display isn't very vivid, tbh my eyes feel a bit strained sometimes.• Battery life (personally it lasts as long as my free time does so for me, it's not a Huge con)I was lucky to have gotten this as a lightning deal. Please note that that after installing sims , I'm almost out of internal storage. I hadn't downloaded anything else at the time so idk if it would handle it with alot of other stuff stored as well.
225	tv	I bought this laptop for college and for the occasional browsing of the internet while waiting for class to start. It's extremely slow, not only does it take it forever to start up, it struggles to open up chrome. The overall look of this laptop is okay but the build is extremely cheap. Not to mention that the screen quality is terrible you can hardly even see anything at all it's worse than an old crt tv from the 90's ! Bottom line is do not buy this laptop it's way too and shouldn't even be considered.
226	tv	I wanted to keep this laptop so bad. Loved the feel and the color. Very easy on the eyes. The ONLY reason I had to return it was the space bar. It was clicky/plasticky. It was all keys on that row. Rest of the keys were firm and silent but hitting that space bar got very annoying. I do recall I had issues with Asus because of that.If you are not sensitive to things like that as I am, you’ll love this laptop!I will go back to HP Stream and see how that is.
227	tv	So far, so good. It just arrived yesterday and this laptop is very nice. It is super light and works great. I definitely recommend this product.
228	tv	This description is completely incorrect. I spoke with asus and made Amazon aware that this is a dual core processor, not a quad core processor as it states in more than one area of the description. It may be a perfectly nice dual core computer, that I don't know. But it's definitely not what the description says it is. Luckily Amazon quickly refunded my money when I immediately returned it but I also informed them that they needed to change the description because that's basically fraudulent advertising. They told me the issue was escalated but it'll be interesting to see how long this incorrect description remains.
229	tv	this unit took quite a while to download the updates but once it was done it is great for what it was designed for.
230	tv	June 17, 2019: ASUS support tells me that I must send the machine for additional test/repairs. UNACCEPTABLE. The tech I worked with over a month ago told me that if the problem returned my machine would be replaced.  I will not send this back in. The only acceptable resolution is replacement. I've lost literally months while this machine went back and forth to the ASUS repair facility and I'm still stuck with brick.  I will never buy another ASUS computer. This is literally the worst computer purchase I've ever made and I've been using these things since the late 1980s.June 13, 2019: THIS COMPUTER LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THE REPAIR FACILITY FOR THE SECOND TIME LESS THAN A WEEK AGO and the issues have returned AGAIN. I'll never buy another ASUS product. This is garbage, the brand is garbage and I just want my machine replaced or money returned. This is absurd. If I could give this machine a negative rating I would...I've brought my rating down to one star. You can see my original review after my update.Update:The problem with the fans grew worse. I tried updating all the drivers and this failed to fix the problem. I contacted support and spent about thirty minutes walking through the issue with them. They issued and RMA and I sent the computer out for a warranty repair. My computer was out for about three weeks and when it was returned to me, the problem was alleviated, but only for about a week, at which time the fans gradually spun up more and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time.  Right now, the fans have literally been running, and they are VERY LOUD for the past two hours. I'll close the laptop and the fans will spin down, but within half an hour, they spin up again. The computer actually woke me up last night when the fans kicked in (with the laptop closed).I spoke to support again, and this time the agent told me the behavior was normal. Okay, right.In addition, this computer's track pad is the worst I've ever had.  It's almost unusable.I regret purchasing this machine. It is absolutely the worst computer purchase I've ever made.OriginalI bought this computer primarily for a mobile DAW. In general, it supports everything I do in terms of audio recording and editing. However, there's a couple caveats I feel I must share with others. 1. The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago. I've disabled all but the essential startup items and currently I am running only Chrome. No other applications are running. The computer isn't even warm. It's really annoying. I was one version behind on the BIOS, so I flashed it with the latest. No change. 2. The track pad isn't great. Sometimes it's weirdly sensitive and mistakes a scroll for a click. Other times scrolling is difficult (it will scroll smoothly and suddenly stumbles requiring that I move the cursor to the side and try again. If that doesn't work I just go to the scroll bar and go from there.So while the computer is suited to my needs, it's drawbacks are very frustrating. I'm considering sending it back.
231	tv	i bought the rtx2070 512m2 16gb. I would give it 4.7 stars if i could. its a great laptop but its not perfect.If you plan on playing games you really need to buy an extra stick of memory with the 16gb model. Games will run mediocre without it but ur frame rates will increase 90-110% when you add the 2nd channel (depending on the game). Shadow of the tomb raider averaged 50fps with med-high settings with 1 channel, it jumped to over 90 fps with ultra high settings. Resident evil 2 remake went from 60-85 to 105-144 (cus vsync probably) on highest settings.It's great for work. The 144hz panel makes everything look smooth. I got lucky, my panel only has a little light bleed in the corners and can only be seen when the screen goes completely dark.Fans are loud. Use headphones. The speakers are pretty good, u need to turn it up really loud to over power the fans.  Panel is not gsync.. but 144hz so doesn't really matter.update: Worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the graphics card decided to disconnect itself from the computer. Couldn't find it in bios. My guess is high temps probably loosened a solder joint. I still like the computer so i ordered a replacement.
232	tv	The pros:1. Beautiful screen2. Solid build3. Easy to upgrade (ram or storage)4. The speaker sounds great5. Easy to monitoring the basic information by software and control the fans and colour of the keyboard (Armoury Crate)The cons1. Touch pad not big enough2. Fans maybe too loud when overboost mode3. Blue screen issues (I think it’s just a individual problem but it’s happened when I play game)When I playing game, this laptop provide a beautiful display and good sound quality to me to enjoy. Unfortunately, my laptop seem have something wrong (software or hardware problem), it always blue screen when playing game and I try to fix it (e.g. update the driver or windows) by finding the solution on internet but the situation still happen. Another problem is after I install GeForce Experience, it might have a weird colour dots randomly appear and the laptop might going to freeze or blue screen.I returned this product and it delivered to return center over a weeks but I still waiting for my refund. Unlucky and Disappointed experience I shops on amazon!
233	tv	The good: Initially pleased with product at unboxing.  Was pleased with minimal bloatware (except McAffee which comes preloaded and pushy). Device has a cool appearance. Easy to change backlit keyboard colors etc and overall solid construction. Snappy responses for basic apps.The Meh: It is a large, heavy laptop. At the outer edge of what I consider portable. But fine for my purposes which don't require constant movement. Screen quality is very average.The Bad: On the 3rd startup the network adapter failed to appear. Device basically showed that no wifi card was installed. 2 hours of troubleshooting and ASUS support recommended I return it. Also, while it was working I ran some basic diagnostics and performance. While CPU appeared fast, graphics and overall performance did not equal the sum of the parts as I expected. Perhaps if I had it longer I could have tweaked.
234	tv	I tried to like this laptop. The fans are loud like most laptops. Its so loud it disturbs others in the same room. The battery is horrible just like other gaming laptops. This particular laptop kept crashing during gaming at random times. Also, apparently it has a RTX 2070 graphics card but I can only play many of my favorite games like BFV and Anthem with Low-Medium graphics settings and even then its buggy and laggy. Not sure if my laptop was defective or what but I know that's not normal. I have another computer with a 1070 and I play BFV and Anthem on Max settings so go figure. Long story short I returned this laptop very quickly. My laptop was the version with RTX 2070.***Edit: March 20 2018: I returned the laptop very quickly like I said and unfortunately even though Amazon has had it for 2 weeks I have still not received credit for the return even after reaching out to them 3 times. They assured me several times that the credit will be issued in 24 hours but I have still yet to receive it so I had to make a payment on my credit card because of this! Unacceptable business practices Amazon 😤
235	tv	"Purchased this guy to upgrade from an ASUS GL-502VM.The build quality is leaps and bounds higher. Virtually no deck flex and feels super solid.The screen quality is good. I do wish it were a 1440p display and/or it had G-sync support, but at least it runs well at 144Hz. As with other nVidia laptops, if you hook up a G-sync compatible display via DisplayPort, it works.The NVME SSD that it comes with isn't incredibly fast compared to the Samsung 960 EVO that I replaced it with, but it's still faster than SATA.Speaking of SATA, it does come with the ability to add your own 2.5"" SATA SSD. Comes with a cage for it, and a special fiddly ribbon connector as it doesn't have SATA data or power ports on the motherboard. Not very difficult to install, but it does require a careful touch to not mess up the ribbon connector's latch.More about upgrades. You can upgrade the RAM. At least partially. Opening the back gives you access to the M.2 slot, SATA drive and 1 DIMM slot. I'm not sure if it has 8GB soldered to the motherboard, or if there's a 2nd DIMM slot on the other side of the motherboard.The speakers on this thing are fantastic. They produce a lot more bass than I initially thought they would. They fire out the right and left sides around the bottom of the keyboard so they aren't easily covered by hands. They can also get quite loud without distorting or vibrating the chassis.It took me a while to figure out the Aura stuff for changing the keyboard lighting (and disabling the light strip on the front which I find kind of obnoxious).The CPU and GPU are both fantastic and keep cool, as well as keeping the keyboard cool so it's comfortable to game on for a long time. Keep in mind that unlike the Pascal cards, the mobile variants of these Turing cards are not identical to the desktop cards. They have a bit less SU's and are clocked a bit slower.The trackpad is glass as well as having separate right and left click buttons. It uses Windows Precision drivers as well. It still has some troubles that I can't seem to work out yet (sometimes input is ignored for a second or two), but most people probably won't use it too often.Overall, I love this thing and will probably continue to use it for several years down the road."
236	tv	I was super happy with this within the first 24hrs of receiving it. I’m a 3d artist and I found this laptop ran my primary programs smoothly without too much of a fuss.And then I went to close the lid at work after a long day at the grind... and I noticed the screen was peeling back from the casing and the glue.Since I want this laptop the most I’m going to give it a second chance with a replacement.Did amazon send me a referb when I ordered new?
237	tv	The design is superb, very stylish and eye-grabbing, without being tacky. The RGB keyboard is great, although I have to play around a little bit more with the settings to see if there is individual colour backlighting on these, the marketing materials do not seem to mention it.It's a spec beast, that's for sure. It feels super smooth while using most software for video editing and graphic design. Would have liked to see a GTX 1060 instead of a GTX1050 Ti in here to take advantage of the 120hz screen in more games, but it does the trick for the MOBA games I usually play. The screen is gorgeous, and quite an upgrade from most laptops in the price range. Colours are accurate and great for both work and gaming.Highly recommended if purchased at the right price.
238	tv	I honestly thought due to the review and the price this computer would work well. But ive been having more and more issues with it. Ive had it for a little less than a year now and ive had to factory reset it mutple times just so i could open some files. It good at the begining no problems, then everything kina goes to crap. My led keyboard has malfunctioned multiple times and the ROG gaming center is just all over the place. I constantly have to look up how to resolve stupid issues. I give it 2 stars cause it was great at the beginning. Honestly though i would not suggest this laptop to anyone. Hope this helps, wish there was someone to tell me before I spent 1200$.
239	tv	This laptop works incredibly well and I'd give it a much higher rating if it weren't for the fact that it constantly freezes. It has had these random freezes for a long time now and I haven't been able to find the cause or any pattern to when they will happen. It makes doing any work or gaming on this computer very difficult. Other than this, the computer is actually very well-built with a vibrant monitor, but I cannot give it a higher rating.
240	tv	I have had my Zephyrus S for a few days now and really like the performance. I chose this laptop over the MSI GS65 Stealth due to the specs bejng better slightly better and the cooling system having better reviews. This laptop does not disappoint performance wise and cooling. I play the provided Call of Duty at max setting  for a few hours at a time and the cpu and GPU temp average about 65 degrees. The battery is not as great as the stealth, but that does not bother me because I mainly have the laptop plugged in . So far my only complaint, which is why I am only giving 4/5 stars, is that the screen bleed which started after a couple days of having it, is the worst I have ever expierenced. I will be contacting support this see how this can be fixed because it is quite distracting. Also, note that this laptop does not come with a Ethernet port or a Thunderbolt port, the wireless card does work great though. Some boxes came with a USB to Ethernet cords, but mine did not so I had to go out and buy one for about $20. The picture I included shows the screen bleed I had last night.
241	tv	Have had my eye on this PC for a long time and picked it up yesterday and ran some tests. I previously had a MSI GT80 Titan with two 970m SLI, this PC performs about 10 percent better than my old PC, but pretty much 1/5 the size. Laptop, although much lighter than my old PC, is actually surprisingly heavier than it looks (which is a plus for me, I like a PC with a little heft).My main concern was cooling, and I can say this PC has it in SPADES. I ran a RE6 Benchmark Test (it's what I had on me at the time) on High Settings as well as two 60 fps youtube channels and the temperature never spiked past 82 C, it usually kept to a general 75-78 C temperature range. You can quickly bring up Armoury Crate Software with the Asus Logo Button (located on the upper right hand corner of the keyboard, above the trackpad) and set Fan profiles based on the game, or let it automatically set it's own fan speed depending on bearing load.I'm still performing some tests so things can be subject to change, but so far, this PC has turned out to be the real deal. A bit of caution for anyone looking to buy though, remember this PC does NOT came with a Thunderbolt Plug, I knew this going in and it didn't effect me but it may matter to you. Also remember, naturally, if you plan to use this for heavy use this version of the Zephyrus S (1070 Max Q Version) ONLY has SSD, there is no extended hard drive so you will need an external one. Also keep in mind, much like the Razer Blade 15, this laptop has NO Ethernet Port. If you're going to buy this and you're a serious no holds barred gamer, then you can pretty much consider buying a USB Type C Hub (the ones with the Ethernet Port) pretty much part of the deal as well.Pros:+ Arguably the Strongest Contender for the best thermals and cooling of any current super thin gaming laptop on the market. You can clearly tell the main thing that keeps this puppy cooled is nothing but good old fashioned mechanical ingenuity.+ Extremely Light and Powerful for it's size, using Armoury Crate Software you can overclock the GPU and reach pretty much full GTX 1070 level performance.+ Very reasonably Priced for what you get.+ Slim and Sleek Design. The Zephyrus S is designed elegantly, but at the same time it's not ostentatious. You could most likely bring this into a business meeting or a library and you wouldn't draw unneeded attention.Cons:- No Ethernet Port or Thunderbolt Connection- The side by side trackpad and keyboard is considered unconventional by some (I consider this a pro though, I LOVE the setup, it's so fancy)- SSD ONLY (for the 1070 Max Q Version) be prepared to pick up an External HD or be ready to carefully manage the games you download- RGB lighting is kind of soft on the keyboard. You can increase the lighting intensity, but by most modern day standards it's still going to have more of a soft glow then an in your face level of intensity.- Fans are SURPRISINGLY LOUD when they are at their maximum setting, especially for something so small. Again, I also like this because I respect a machine with a little kick and can flex it's cooling muscles when it needs to. But this could be considered a con for some. Remember that you can always manually adjust fan settings using a button or set an automated profile in Armoury Crate depending on what game you play.Admittedly, I gave this 5 stars because just about all the cons, at least to ME, weren't really cons save for the Ethernet Port and Thunderbolt connection, but I already had a USB Type C hub when I bought this so I was good to go. But I wanted to list those warnings out there for people who are considering this laptop.Before buying, KNOW what you are getting before purchasing this, READ THE FINE SPEC PRINTS, if you can keep that in mind, this PC is a real beauty.**UPDATED REVIEW AFTER MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF USE**Hey guys quick update. After just a little more than one year of use the laptop speakers have broken down and I decided to send the laptop in for repair (for reference the laptop is out of warranty). After about a week I received a repair quote from Asus for a hellaciously high amount of money ($1437). According to Asus, in order to fix the speaker issue the Motherboard will need to be replaced, and along with the Motherboard all of it's appropriately soldered components.I chose to reject the payment and have the laptop returned. While the laptop still works great I've decided to purchase a bluetooth speaker and pair it to the laptop but truth be told, the speakers shouldn't have broken after literally only a year and like 2 months of use. I have always taken great care of the laptop (never dropped, hell never even bumped into a wall) so not entirely sure why the speakers crapped out.In any case, because of this whole ordeal I'm going to have to lower my review from Five Stars to Three Stars instead. Just thought some of you out in Amazon land should know.
242	tv	You'll get used to the keyboard placement. You really will. Plus, it actually feels nice to type on. But, you'll quickly start to notice all the little things add up. Screen bleeding has hit a handful of early units (including mine). The screen itself can't be tipped back far enough with the hinge design. You'll place the laptop on a kitchen counter and it is okay, but just a 5/10 degrees off from being able to open the hinge and bend the screen back nicely. Asus and Windows have a horrible time updating together (this includes Nvidia drivers too). Ventilation is the best around... but the bottom panel is flimsy, even with the newly minted S version.I like the forward thinking design. It's for gamers. But, you'll start to see how the battery life, build quality, placement of keyboard/trackpad, no Ethernet jack, screen tilt... all add up. The GS65 Stealth is almost the same laptop with fewer compromises (albeit, runs hot). Had to return the Zerphyrus S.
243	tv	"As a college student, I was looking for a laptop that can be the best of both worlds, something that was light, portable, had decent battery life while having the power to play AAA title games or whatever I threw at it. I decided to wait and use my unit for 2 weeks so I can give a more comprehensive review, though I will say that my review will be written from a college student's perspective and not so much from a professional computer reviewer's perspective.PROS:DESIGN: This laptop is one of the most uniquely designed gaming laptop being sold on the market. Build quality is very nice, sturdy, metal-ly, and minimal flex. The unique keyboard/mousepad layout and its fancy Active Aerodynamic System allows the laptop to stay cool when gaming. Its thin bezels around the display makes the laptop look much more modern and does help contribute to its slim form factor. This laptop is just ever so slightly bigger than the Macbook Pro 15 with Touch bar, very impressive. ASUS did a great job designing the outer shell of the laptop to be subtle and clean, allowing you to take it to the office or coffee shop and not attract attention to itself, though I would be lying if I did not say that the laptop did catch some intrigued glances in my classes.PERFORMANCE: This laptop makes procrastination very easy to achieve as it can run close to any game currently out and popular smoothly. With the fans running on balanced mode, graphics all maxed out, CPU/GPU stock, (See attached photos), I was able to get around 140-230 fps on CS:GO with GPU and CPU temps around 64C and 75C respectively. For Far Cry 3 (I know, I know, it's an outdated game but I really enjoy playing it), I was getting around 60-80 fps with GPU hovering at 62C and CPU at around 75C. I was able to redeem Black Ops 4, play it on max, and was alos getting performance slightly better than Far Cry 3. This laptop should be able to play any games on the market and sustain minimum 60fps most of the time.DISPLAY: Color accuracy is great. Colors look vibrant from every video I watched. I've used my laptop out in direct sunlight and never really had an issue with visibility, thanks to its decent max brightness as well as its matte-finish, eliminating major glares. Its fast 144hz refresh rate and 3ms response time makes gaming and even just swinging the mouse cursor back and forth really fast enjoyable.BATTERY LIFE: Some may list this as a con but some people tend to forget that gaming laptops are very power hungry.  I did read somewhere that the battery size of the GX531 was around like 50Wh, a bit on the smaller side. The Nvidia Optimus technology monitored the laptop's battery usage quite nicely and I was able to squeeze out a good 4.5 hours on 33% brightness cramming for my finals before the laptop needed to be charged. That for me is more than enough to make me happy but of course, more would make me happier.CONS:(Before continuing reading, most of the cons I list pertain to what I experienced on my unit. I may have gotten unlucky I guess.)DISPLAY: Some reviewers on Amazon post that their unit has backlight bleed and I am sad to say that my unit suffers the same fate. From the attached picture(I don't know why my phone was having a hard time focusing), there are noticeable backlight bleeds on the top-left and bottom-right corner. The picture makes it difficult to tell but in actuality, the top-left corner is the worst out of the bunch. The bleeds are not that noticeable but every now and then when the screen becomes black, from like a video or a game-loading screen, it becomes painfully obvious.SPEAKERS: Sound quality is great but once I start to raise the volume past 50%, the sound becomes progressively distorted, especially on high notes. Not good :(KEYBOARD: This one is interesting. You know how keycaps are elevated above the 'keyboard frame'? For my unit, the 'keyboard frame' around the 'i' keycap is elevated to the point where the keycaps and the 'keyboard frame' are flush with each other (see attached picture for better idea). I often found myself trying to press the 'i','j','k', (any keycaps essentially in that area), only to push down on the 'keyboard frame' instead. I could push the frame back down with my fingernail, but within a day, the frame slowly rises up to match the height of the keycaps.FINAL VERDICT: I wanted to give MY specific unit 3.5/5 stars. Even though 2 of the 3 cons I listed above are negated by the external peripherals (headphones, USB keyboard and mouse) I connect and use when I game, when time comes to use the laptop without those peripherals and I notice the cons, it makes me think ""I shouldn't be experiencing these issues, especially for the price I paid"". After noticing these cons, everyday I think to myself whether I should just return the item as defective, get a replacement, and hope for the best or I should just live with these issues. I will probably return it for a replacement. The reason I rounded up and gave my unit an overall 4/5 stars is because of this. The laptop, in my opinion, just looks so cool and the performance the laptop outputs is very impressive. It is pretty much everything I wanted in a laptop. So for those that find my unprofessionally written review, take the time to read it all, and are deciding on whether or not to buy the device, I would personally recommend it."
244	tv	Wow, what can I say... let me try to constrain my emotions and keep my ROG fan boy inside my pants for a moment and write an unbiased review to the best of my abilities.1. \\CPU is amazing\\ it blows my dell's i7-7700HQ out of the water. x700HQ has been a staple for years and who wouldve thought 8th gen intel has come so far. it does everything so buttery smooth in windows 10 and 6-cores (12 threads)2. \\GPU is amazing\\This is one of the thinnest laptop if not the thinnest that I have ever seen or used with these type of specs. GTX 1070 max P is definitely a powerful beast. It runs BF1 at max settings at 1080p perfectly fine, with G-Sync turned onI would say at this point, built-in display limited at 1080p is becoming a let downbut matters not, I am going to test the limits of it via a USB-C thunderbolt to DisplayPort cable and hook it up to an AGON AG352UCG6 monitor and run it at 120Hz G-Sync and see how it does at 3440x14403D Mark11 yielded around 22K of scoremost importantly is there is a switch for turning the dedicated graphics off, just using Intel that saves a lot of battery power if I am just doing a presentation on the go, it is nice they've thought of this instead of making a pure gaming machine (no laptop should be so single purposed)3. \\Friggin fast SSD\\I do graphics work and video editing work on this occassionally and it has kept up with loading Premier and transcoding the files very fast, thanks to the graphics card being utilized by Adobe. When transfering the large files, its kept up its paces too although I am not putting the drive to work nearly its advertised limits since I/O is still the limitation. There is a Dell thunderbolt 3 external SSD Drive out, I may buy that and test it outI believe this SSD inside the ASUS is an iteration of the Samsung 970 EVO, definitely one of the fastest out there (except for the Pro)the 1TB hybrid drive is no slouch either, enough to store some of the files (while the rest are on NAS), and hasnt been too much of a bottle beck4. \\Clever chassis design\\The chassis is pretty smart, since it has a piece on the bottom that pops open when I open the lid to a certain degreethis has allowed for cooler air to enter from the bottom and sides, especially useful as a tilt that helps with my typing tooThis is particularly useful too when using on the lap or on the bed where bottom tends to get muffled with blankers or something softwith about an hour of encoding, the cooling setup inside has kept the machine not too noisy, doing its job of efficiently cooling the GPU and CPUthe keyboard area has remained fairly cool, under 45C for most of the time5. \\Decent screen\\Screen and its bezels are the only partial let down of the machinevisually, the quality is great and i havent noticed any blurring or tearing with G-Sync turned oncolor accuracy seems good enough for most graphics work although I still use an external monitor with higher DCI-P3 profile for video editingI havent experienced much input lag or slow response time so things are peachy therebezels though.... they are still large in a day and age where infinite edge displays and super narrow bezels are becoming common on $1300 laptops, yet this $2k machine is still rocking the thick arse bezels... what gives?6. \\Fancy keyboard and lighting\\There is some glow around the laptop and backlit keyboard is pretty colorfulI am not one for the rainbow scheme of color in my gaming laptop so ive set it to just red and dim for nowthere are so many apps and settings that I havent gone deep enough to figure it all out yetand that is one of the problems... too many apps and settings!I suppose I am not geeky enough wanting to tinker with those all the time7. \\Upcoming upgrades\\Seeing how I am running close to the 16GB of RAM, I plan on adding another 16GB soonI opened up the mem bay and it is a good sign that both slots are operable, while only one is occupied by the 1x16GB 2666, I will add another 16GB soonAnother upgrade is I plan on adding a thunderbolt 3 port hub that has more USB ports, displayport out (USB-C alt mode), gigabit ethernethard to find one that exactly matches my need so will need to do a bit more research (watch out for compatibility with 4K monitors)
245	tv	"RTX 2070 Max Q 15"" inch versionThe design of this laptop is outstanding, a beautiful piece to look at indeed.Display:The first thing i have checked is the display, sadly it does have light bleed but it is very minimal and not noticable at all. Only when you look for it.Performance & Temps:I was easily getting above 144 fps on Fortnite, with the balanced gaming mode with temps reaching at 80C max.From 80 to 120 fps in dota ( high settings ) which reached max temp of 83 to 85 C.Overall this laptop can tackle any game if you will accept the turbo mode fan noise.This laptop have never throttled and the temps were always below 90C, the fan noise is quieter than what I have expected, and if you will wear a gaming headset with closed ear you wont hear it at all.However sometimes you will get some fps fluctuations which can be fixed/minimised with GPU driver updates and using Vulkan support in Dota 2, if you prefer to avoid all that go for the 17 inch version which has G-Sync support.Sound:The sound quality is ok id give it 7/10 its not bad seeing how thin the laptop is.Keyboard:This keyboard is much better than any keyboard i have tried, so comfortable to type on and no spelling mistakes unlike desktop keyboards. And you wont feel any heat which is the best thing about this laptop design.Ports:Sad that there is no thunderbolt 3 port, RJ45, however the laptop wifi card is so good that you don't need a RJ45 port, the connection is tested and theres no packet loss or stutter at all.Battery life:It can be extended easily with power saving mode up to 3 to 4 hours on browsing and normal use. However you will need to carry a charging brick with you everywhere or a 65W power adapter to charge it with USB C.Overall id give this laptop 8.5 out of 10.However If you have the money i recommend buying the 17 inch version just for that G sync panel, other than that this laptop is great and i have no regrets at all.I will post photos later and include further details incase i notice anything.Edit: temps mentioned above are for CPU, GPU temps were mostly below 65 C which is amazing.Edit December 2019:Thanks for the helpful votes!One of the downsides I noticed about this laptop is the storage. Only up to 1TB of PCiE SSD and it is a hassle to install it. There is a video on YouTube on how to open up this laptop which helps. Laptop still running good though."
246	tv	"Powerful laptop. Runs everything I've thrown at it. Looks great. Lightweight. Very quiet when not under load. If you crank the fans up, expect to hear a jet engine nearby, though!I gave it -1 star because it gets INSANELY hot unless you properly configure it for your games. ThrottleStop is your friend.-1 star because, upon opening this morning... the casing for the hinge seriously just broke off. Nothing of note happened upon opening. I seriously just opened the lid and ""POP"" -- clean break into two difference pieces. It appears as though there was supposed to be some type of metal rod inserted inside of it to better anchor the plastic cap -- but mine doesn't have one. I am now left here debating if I should call them for a replacement due to this -- or simply superglue it back on. In either case, this never should have happened and has really left a bad taste in my mouth for any potential future purchase from ASUS as I continually hear issues about their QC."
247	tv	As many users have reported, my order came with strong ips glow/backlight bleeding. Also, I had a stuck white pixel out of the box. For these reasons I requested a refund for the laptop and I'll give it another chance. I've just ordered a new one. It's a shame that Asus has such a terrible quality control for their high end laptops.Pros:- SUPER THIN and light. Thinner than i've imagined.- Amazing cooling. I was getting 63 degrees celcius on GPU and around 82 on CPU while heavy BF5 load. GPU max temperature was 65 and CPU had a peak at 95 (but overall stable at 80 - 85).- Keyboard positioning is better than many people are imagining. It is not bad at all, trust me, you will get used to it (left handed talking).- Awesome USB C charging options. That was one of the reasons that made me decide to buy this machine.Cons:Screen: Bad quality control. Asus should be ashamed. Lots of IPS Glow and a dead/stuck pixel. Watching dark scenes in movies and games was bad, especially coming from a OLED Alienware R3. Also, the screen was very badly centralized regarding the bezels. On the top I had huge space from the screen to the bezel (larger on the left size). Why Asus, why?- Not very confortable to use the touchpad on bed or sitted, because the right corner of the laptop will be in the center of your hand, hurting a little bit after some time. But I wouldn't remove a star for that.- Fans are very good but loud as *****. Seriously, very loud while heavy load. But I dont care if its keeping the product cool. Higher up the volume or use a headset.I'll also review my second Zephyrus when it arrives. If it comes with screen problems, I advise everyone to forget about this device.I hope this review helps.
248	tv	"A loud and angry beast indeed, that eats up graphic intensive games and spits them out asking for more!So I am coming from a 17"" G series Asus RoG, which was a great machine for the genre of gaming I was most interested in.  However, my interest started getting peaked in the 15.3"" smaller/thinner laptops from Asus, but I was really concerned with the heating issues that they seemed to experience in the early stages of development as they sought to go smaller/thinner.Asus hit the mark with the Zephyrus S!  Gaming is a whole new experience with the GTX 1070 matched up to the amazing screen.  The smaller bezel really does give the appearance of a much larger screen and my initial concerns of losing game experience due to screen size is not an issue at all.  Not seeing the light bleed that I have seen other reviewers experience so I think that really could be accounted to a bad run on QC.Did I say loud and angry?  Well this thing is a beast and a beast needs to breathe.  It does run loud on turbo settings and above because you are pushing the laptop to play a graphic intensive game.  However, I had no problem web surfing or watching videos while in balanced, silent, or even windows mode with no temp issues.  You ask for something to push hard in a small package, you need to expect it need to breathe heavy, period.  Can't hear it with headphones on and most people will have them on for gaming anyway.This is an Ultra Slim laptop, not a cordless one.  Just because it is very portable and easy to move around with does not mean that you still do not need power.  The many reviewers that complain about battery life seem to forget this when using this laptop as if they can use this machine without it being plugged in and expect massive battery life.  People need to stop acting as if there isn't outlets all over this world when they absolutely need to game on the run, and just plug it in.  Seriously, you can't complain about battery life when trying to run this type of graphic card/cooling system/screen/SDD/etc/etc while not being plugged in.A few weeks in now and this Asus is making me just as happy with the purchase of my old Asus RoG brick that I replaced with this purchase.  Can't wait to wear this one out and see what Asus offers in the future."
249	tv	i love this machine, already a good part of my life. here is why i like it, and some considerations -graphics:- gtx1070 is really strong. BDO and Farcry5 ran on max graphics >60fps, 1080 res.- i plug hdmi to my TV to view 4k res, it runs at 30-40 fps comfortably at max graphics.- asus auto throttles the GFX if it gets too hot, lack of power, etc. this is kind of irritating, you can turn on fan to full blast - which generally sets GPU performance higher. but surely sound a lot noiser.gfx fan:- to start, most AAA games will make the fan whirr fast, high pitch and noticeably loud.- you can throttle anytime with pre-installed ASUS software (ROG gaming center), but that will reduce your FPS. i let it run and turn up my game louder. my mind will selectively ignore it after a while.hdd:- the solid state is very fast, but smaller, my config has 237gb usable space SSD. the 1TB is a hybrid SATA HD (with small SSD component) that supposed to auto prioritize frequently accessed files for faster speed. not noticeable difference for me. has 931GB usable space, reported by windows 'my computer'.processing power/ RAM:CPU: i7-8750H intel coffee lake 6 core, 12 threads = incredibly fast. multi-tasking mastery.also includes intel UHD 630 onboard GPU - this GPU sidekick can run youtube/ pptx, without slowing down your GFX card working hard on your games.my config is 16gb ram, great for most purposes - i wish i had 32gb for my VM images, which cost quite a bit - maybe i'll upgrade sometime later.physical design/ dimensions:really thin when closed. metal finish is great.when screen is open, bottom lifts up a bit to give a gap for airflow. nice design.HOWEVER, the laptop must stay open, for better airflow. this is a small problem, as i plug laptop to my big TV, hoping to keep my laptop closed for gaming. partial workaround is to display to TV but not laptop, saving my laptop screen/ better FPS by using only 1 screen, etc.laptop stays at comfortable temperature throughout the intensive gaming.this is much better layout than other zephyrus, with large toughpad below keyboard, like all other laptops.i carry this when i travel (about 3kg+ with 'big brick' charger), now i game on the fly!!i use wireless mouse/ keyboard, with this laptop plugged to my big screen. so GFX fan noise don't bother me.keyboard lights are very useful in the dark. and you can turn them off completely if you need to.the 'gamevisual' app that does this is a bit slow/ laggy.it is nowhere as portable as my MS surface pro (<1kg), but much more portable than most gaming laptops.ports:lots of ports on the left/right side of laptop. nothing behind it, to allow incredible design for air flow.note that power port on the left side. if that matters to where you place your laptop.power:its reviewed that battery do not last long - when im not plugged in, i can play farcry for 1-2 hours (tested)otherwise, for reading, ms office work, it should last 3hrs+ (not tested)
250	tv	Design (5/5): Mechanically, this laptop is beautiful and elegantly designed. The bottom air vent that opens when the screen lid opens which was a pleasant surprise! Something so simple, yet useful. The RGB/AURA lighting works as intended and is a nice, non-ostentatious touch. EXTREMELY thin and light for such a huge powerhouse.Screen (5/5): The screen is bright, crisp, and quick. The 144 Hz. refresh rate and deep black level makes everything look beautiful.GPU (5/5): The RTX 2080 handles everything I can throw at it and just keeps churning, but that's to be expected.Cooling (5/5): Under full load, bench, and stress tests, the LT increases RPM fan speed as needed. Very quiet considering the amount of power it is usingUsefulness (5/5) : Both my GF and I travel and frequently work from home. This LT, in combination with my desktop, allows us to never miss out on productivity and fun. Whether it is gaming, rendering 3D images or any other CAD, it's a seamless transition.I highly recommend!Worthwhile mentions: All of the included ASUS software is extremely easy for the end user to navigate. Giving you as much control as you can handle.
251	tv	"I have worked in technology for 30 years, and decided to research and look for a laptop that would satisfy my needs while traveling for a while. I basically have two needs: 1) I wanted a gaming laptop to play my RTS games whenever I got board, and 2) a good editing laptop for my dji drone videos and photography editing using Adobe Premier, Photoshop and other of their products. Both requirements are a laptops worst nightmare. The CPU requirements for intense video require power, and generate intense heat. The worst thing for a laptop. I researched and bought the ROG because they addressed both issues really well. The opening of the bottom panel exposing the internal board allows for heat dispersion and the  GeForce RTX 2080 performs above my expectations. The battery lasts plenty long if not gaming, but adequate under intense loads. This was to be expected, but the unit remains warm, never hot under extreme loads while rendering my videos and gaming.There were many other well thought out design features and software that surprised me like the internet mobile hotspot feature and others. The design is incredible and I love the keyboard lighting. This was actually more useful than I thought it would be, and not just for looks.Over all, after a lot of research and finally getting to use the laptop, it actually exceeded my expectations and I am relieved that I made the right choice. While expensive, it should last me a while, and I would buy it again. It is the perfect size (I prefer the 15"" not 17""), good weight, good material and performs extremely well.Contrary to some reviews, I love the touchpad on the right side. I am not left handed, so it is out of my way while I type and in a very convenient place for my right hand in case I need it. I love the fact that they moved the keypad to the front so that my palms are not on the hot laptop surface.Very happy with the purchase."
252	tv	If you want no compromises for gaming (or really and GPU/CPU intensive) task, this one is for you.While still being thin and light, it's easy to carry without breaking the back and still managing to pack a punch.Asus seems to have solved the thermal throttling issue that would plague most other configurations with an i7-8750H and 2080 RTX MaxQ thanks to the unique cooling design that takes in air above and below the laptop surfaces, and ejecting heat to the back and sides.Observation so far (a week into ownership) with regards to power management is that  the 230 watt power brick or the power management system (windows firmware ) maybe inadequate for this particular configuration.  While gaming on 1080p in Ultra settings on BF5 (ray tracing enabled), the battery will discharge below 90% and continue to do so even after quitting all intensive tasks and simply browsing or idling.  The battery only begins to recharge after at least 30 minutes of idle activity.  I do use a USB-c hub and plugging in an additional type C power source rectified the discharge problem.
253	tv	It's a great laptop . But as a laptop you won't get every thing . For starters let's go with cons I might be picky but it's tough loveThe worst laptop battery I have ever seen in my life . I got no idea how laptop is going to be useable after a couple of years and when the battery degrades. Second iam left hand and the track pad is right sided so it's really annoying at frist but if you are a left handed you get used to it . 3rd would be upgradeable basically any possible upgrade is wasteful.  As u only got 1 m.2 slot which you got your preinstalled ssd in and 1 memory slot which is occupied. Lastly there is no ethernet port and no included dongle (with a laptop with that price a 10$ dongle should be included) Let's go to pro holy I do truly love this laptopSo with AC ON  you would get max turbo number on cpu for prolonged time while being under full load( with turbo mode on ). And asus rog turbo boost for gpu makes it soo close to a desktop frequencies .as for performance I did my research ( before buyingit ) and found that asus rog laptops tends to run cooler than other thin gaming laptops while maintaining high frequencies ( while what iam about to say is a fact about all gaming laptops but when u turn turbo mode on its it's like a jet engine)
254	tv	"Cons: Limited linux support at this time. Which is understandable since it's brand new hardware. I am pretty sure that I could get this working with a little effort. I am even more sure that it'll be supported fully out of the box with popular distros in a few months or less.  I'd have paid a few hundred more for a thunderbolt3 port or two. The USBC ports appear to be just that, USB.  All of my usability complaints are related to windows 10. I am not saying ""Windows sucks"", it just isn't what I am used to.  It does seem to have issues with driver signing and CUDA, which is a PITA but not really the laptop's fault. I just boot w/o driver signing and it works.Pros: Wicked fast. So fast that I really don't care that I am running windows. Hashcat benchmarks at 27G MD5/sec, 8M MD5crypt/sec, and 49G (!) NTLM/sec. that's at 63 deg C. This drives an Oculus Rift with some effort (fans), and I have only wittnessed heat induced framerate drops once, and the system had other apps running alongside the game (Gorn).  I did some research and determined that this is 50% faster than the fastest computer in the world in June of 2001, which drew megawatts of power and filled a computer center. I don't mind the keyboard/trackpad arrangement but I also have used many awful keyboards across my nearly 40 years of using computers.  The same goes for the screen. I see complaints about bleed here and there but, really, this screen is amazing.  After some time getting it setup and getting used to windows I can honestly say that I am about 90% happy with it given what I paid. One more observation. For CUDA workloads this is 50% slower and 15% hotter than a Tesla V100 under real world workloads. It's also 1/4-1/3 cheaper than a V100 and runs right out of the box w/o suffering the indignity of installing the V100 in a suitable computer. I almost want to build a cluster of these laptops for teh lulz."
255	tv	Works great out of the box, nothing obviously wrong at this point (only had it for a week.)I haven't owned a laptop in ten years so some of this maybe normal. The fans kick on early and often, I have it set to Max performance, it seems loud but I have nothing to compare it to, and if it keeps the unit safe from over heating then I consider that good.It's ridiculously thin, light and powerful. It's expensive but that's the price one pays for state of the art technology.
256	tv	This is a great laptop for gaming and that's what it is intended for. This laptop also does a great job doubling for productivity. I do photography in spare time and it is a breeze with photo editing software. The battery is unpleasing but that is to be expected with gaming Laptops. Additionally they keyboard takes some gettingbuse to. The keyboard being located at the bottom of the laptop takes getting use to when in use on the lap however using the keyboard on a desk is easier to do.
257	tv	I'm not a hardcore gamer but having lived with a Dell E6410 for the last 10 years I knew I wanted to upgrade once that system could no longer even play World of Warships.. So I researched around and decided on this system from Asus.  I do like Asus products to being with, they always seem well made to me.  I decided to go with the RX 2080 GPU so as to get as many years out of this thing going forward as I possibly can, obviously the GPU blows away anything I'm trying to use it for now.  I'm not an expert so I just plugged and played World of Warships with max'ed out settings and was getting 75 fps on average, good enough for me to be impressed.  My only regret is that there wasn't a larger SSD drive configuration with either 1TB or 2TB at the time I bought the laptop, those were not options on the item at the time.
258	tv	"Item arrived dead. Gave it 2 hours to charge per Amazon support.  3rd party is unavailable for assistance due to the holiday.3rd party just adds in an extra step  when you have issues...not happy for the money paid.This was RMA'd to Asus and as of 1/13/2020 the status is ""repairing"". As of the date I ordered the product, it will most likely be almost 30 days until the laptop is finished (eta 1/16/2020) and mailed back to me (likely 1/23/2020)."
259	tv	The GPU in the machine I received is not precisely what's advertised. The page says it comes with an RTX 2080 MaxQ 90w, with a 990-1230mhz clock speed. That's the stock spec for the 90w version of the GPU.What I actually got was a 2080 MaxQ 90w, with a base clock of 735mhz, but under load it goes all the way up to 1985mhz out of the box.  Performance wise, it appears to be between the 90w 2080 MaxQ stock and the full 2080 mobile version. So far, it seems better than I expected.
