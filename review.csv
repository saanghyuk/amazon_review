HP updates all drivers comfortably and window update works well. Box has only notebook and power chord.

30	1 January 2020	Best one, for this price!	5.0	I always worried about purchasing a laptop online. But, this one cleared all my worries, and thank you Amazon for this wonderful product! All the ports are working properly, and no damage is noticed. As promised, I received the genuine version of Windows 10 Home. Battery backup is also good, lasting for around 4-5 hours of moderate use. The Intel's Pentium Gold processor is also quite well, close to Core i3's. Also MS-Office 2019 is pre-installed in the laptop, which is yet to be activated. I uninstalled MacAfee security which is also preinstalled, as the Windows Defender works quite well. I surprised to see even netflix is pre-installed!If you are looking for a laptop for moderate home and office purposes (like MS office, browsing internet, netflix, etc), I would suggest you to go for it!	https://www.amazon.in/HP-da0389tu-15-6-inch-Integrated-Graphics/product-reviews/B07SQGQLYT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

When I have called to Amazon customer care, they don't take this issue seriously and reply that plz call Dell customer care we don't do any thing.2.

37	1 April 2019	Worst product - No rating should be given for this	1.0	Never ever purchase Laptops or any other electronic items from online.I've purchased this item from this Amazon, when i started using on day 1 i felt something was unusual and didnt work upto the configuration that it should be, for bootup it took more than a minute, for opening chrome, excel, word or even an explorer it took not less than a minute and i couldnt use the laptop at all. Then i have raised for replacement request after spending lot of time in explaining the issues to amazon, and the product i received as replacement also had same issue and by the time i received the replacement laptop the seller has closed the replacement option for me and when i complained about the replaced product amazon simply washed their hands saying it is my fate and i have to deal with Dell directly.i have even requested amazon to take this product and im ready to buy upgraded/high config laptop, but they simply refused.have spoken to dell customer care for numerous hours, did a clean OS reinstall and all possible options via online/tele support but still the problems remains unresolved.Now im taking this to dell service center and have to wait for another 1 month to get to know the issue.have paid around 30K and spending sleepless nights because of Amazon and their seller.So never ever purchase laptops especially Dell laptops from online sellers, better spend some time and buy from authorized dealers atleast they may not wash their hands as washed by Amazon.	https://www.amazon.in/Dell-Inspiron-3567-15-6-inch-Windows/product-reviews/B07GQNFV85/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0
38	14 October 2018	Awesome laptop at this price range.	5.0	Awesome dell laptops 3567. 15.6Full hd screen is awesome. I m full impress with dell support team. I was having some doubts and they clear all my doubts on phone itself around 1 hrs he talk to me and explained each n everything. I got 15 month mc caffe antivirus plus i checked the dell warranty online its showed that my dell warranty is going to expire on 16-oct-2019 and i purchased it on 10-oct-2018 n delivered on 14-oct-2018. The main benefits of buying this laptop is you get lifetime validity of Windows 10 and ms office validity. I got this for 29*998 amazing pricing. This is my first laptop and i m fully happy and satisfied by both dell and amazon services and product quality is too good looks very premium but little heavy. I asked the dell care about drivers and windows 10 key they told that windows keys are not required because its always there in motherboard and drivers can be installed from there dell site. The laptop was working good. Little slow but dell care told after doing updates it will improve hope so. Basically this laptop is for general uses such as browsing / watching movies or videos plus for office purposes. Its not for hard gaming. The processor speed is 2.3 ghz which is quite good. But trust me guys dell customer support is too good awesome they don't see time they help u till the end  your problems are not resolved. Thanx to amazon dell and the dealer grabagadget.Sound quality is loud and awesome it has dolby speakers was works awesome. Can play YouTube 1080 p hd. Laptop and adapter doesn't heat. The very important thing is its a anti glare display. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is very good.Note* without full updates it will work very slow. Once updated fully its works good. It starts  in 12-18 seconds and if we open ms word it takes 15 seconds.Considering price speed is good. U wont regrets buying this product due fhd + anti glare display / windows 10 lifetime validity / Ms office 2016 lifetime validity / looks premium / very good battery backup around 5-6 hrs / batteries are removable / awesome keyboard / dolby audio quality awesome / dell customer support services is awesome / display very bright. And the best part is laptop and adapter doesn't heat up at all. I have used for more than 12hrs first day for updates but it doesn't heated at all and Adapter too.	https://www.amazon.in/Dell-Inspiron-3567-15-6-inch-Windows/product-reviews/B07GQNFV85/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

66	6 October 2018	Awesome product	5.0	I bought it for my personal use & i'm surprised how it performs. It's super lightweight though battery backup isn't good, might last for 2 hours after a full charge. Switching between tasks is super smooth & no lags even when lots of windows are opened. This is where AMD quad core processor shows its jalwa. I installed windows 10 & it's working awesome. At this price point its supercool product. I got it next day because i'm a prime subscriber. Others might get it late. Go for it, its a jackpot.Note: do check if its covered by hp warranty because in past many people have faced the issue with hp products bought from Amazon. Hp guys say they wont provide warranty for any product bought from Amazon.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-6BF83PA-14-inch-Integrated-Graphics/product-reviews/B07LF5NY25/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

82	3 October 2019	Best at this price	5.0	I bought this for 22990 after discount in bbd ... at this price... this is the best product with pre installed Windows 10 and ms office 2019...

84	29 October 2019	MUST READ	5.0	Hi, used the product for 20 days by now.1. good display FHD.2. Ryzen 3 is best compared with i3.3. Windows 104. Smooth working for 4 gb ram but you have to increase it upto 12gb I guess.5. Nice texture6. Very good ventilation when compared with other laptop like hp.7. Thin8. Battery comes close to 4 hr when used for browsing or for videos I suggest use it in battery saver mode.9. Call (mail) customer service and update warranty for up to 1 year.10. Speakers are above average.11. Keys are very nice to work.12. Hinges are far better now, as it is a long one.13. I suggest to uninstall antivirus (Windows firewall is sufficient) and install chrome for smooth usage(stop that explorer).14. Night vision is good.I brought it for 22k !!! U may get surprised.So,.  5 üåü rating.My opinion:- go for it, it doesn't disappoint you. I think this combination is good . so, it will definitely hit high from now in the market and I will update after some usage.Edit 1:- after 2 months1. I feel display is not great. As it is not IPS2. BATTERY should have been still better than this.3. Main point is it takes time, initially though , for Right click to work.4. AMD gives updates.	https://www.amazon.in/Lenovo-Ideapad-15-6-inch-Windows-81UT001CIN/product-reviews/B07X45PMXF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

86	14 October 2019	Good	3.0	I got this at 25.5k seller said he wont reduce price but its a lie now its 24k after 2 weeks =(Anyways so i have used this for at least 2-3 weeks so i can comment on performance- Battery Life : Not very good but not bad. Lasts 3-6 hours depending on use. If you wanna do light programming and browsing you have around 4 hours . Light gaming and browsing/music gives 3.5 hours. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING duh for that buy a gaming laptop/xbox or whatev else that is MEANT for gaming.-Free stuff : YOU DO GET MS 2019 (feb) now since you get feb you wont get those cute logos (new ones) but still all features are same. Mcaffee is free for 365 days too =)-you can do light stuff on it-Features that are available on high end laptops like bendable screen(180degrees) and sleek design , thin bezels ARE there. LOOKS GREAT-AMAZING SPEAKERS-POOR WEBCAMThats it :)if you get intel i3 model around 27k then buy that. If this is at 25k buy amd a9. I think you should go for amd a9 as if this is 20/20 then that is 19/20 (just comparing but ryzen 3 isnt 20/20)however for student needs this is perfect. IF YOU DONT DO PROGRAMING AND JUST NEED FOR browsing and making projects and play internet games buy hp chromebook at 24k which is having touch screen today.	https://www.amazon.in/Lenovo-Ideapad-15-6-inch-Windows-81UT001CIN/product-reviews/B07X45PMXF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

101	9 October 2018	Detailed Review of Product itself !!!	3.0	NOTE :@ Its Available on other Online stores as well, so check before you purchase.@ This model don't have Touchscreen, so note that.For using this device for couple of weeks, following are the observations from Normal User point of view.First I am mentioning the Specs and then I will explain the User Experience.Following are the Specifications :------------------------------------------# Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i3-7020U processor# 1 TB storage, 4GB DDR-4 RAM# Integrated Intel 620 Graphics# 14 inch HD Display with Resolution 1366*768.# 3-cell (41WHR) battery & Windows 10 OS.Following is the my user Experience :BUILD-QUALITY :------------------------# It has good build quality compared to price.# The top surface has matte finish and has good grip.# Speakers has good output.# It weighs around 1.5 KG, which is moderate weight considering the size.# Finally it looks good.DISPLAY :------------# HD LED screen with a resolution of 1366*768 performs great.# Colours are Punchy.# Contrast is well above average.# Display performs well upto my expectations.KEYBOARD & SPEAKERS :------------------------------------# Keyboard Doesn't have backlit.# Feedback from keyboard is good.# It Doesn't have a Numpad.# Placement pf speakers are good,# Has Enough sound output.# Performance is above average.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :--------------------------------------# Its average performing battery.# With full charge I used to clock above 3 hours of battery backup.# It charges under 3 hours.# Even with Medium Brightness and heavy Multitasking, I used to get above 2 hours of backup.# So overall battery backup is below average.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :------------------------------------# I had NO problems while using this laptop for surfing and browsing internet.# Small and medium games also runs smoothly on it.# It Doesn't have fingerprint scanner.# Has 1x USB 2 and 2x USB 3 ports which are handy combination.# So to conclude its Average laptop.VERDICT :-------------Its a good device if the price would have being around 25k. UPS of this device is 7th gen processor, decent Storage and HP brand reliability. But apart from that there's hardly anything to attract. It lacks fingerprint sensor, Backlit keyboard, decent battery backup, better graphics and better display resolution. If there's a deal and if its available around 25k then go for it, else invest few thousand more and go for better device. For 30k its Not worth buying.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-14q-cs0006TU/product-reviews/B07FMVPJ2F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

105	9 November 2018	The laptop lags frequently for no reason, Not sure if this is a genuine laptop from HP	1.0	I bought this laptop a month back during Amazon great indian festival. Been using it since then.The product is light weight, Sound is good, battery backup is good. But the important of all , the performance is horrible.I've exchanged my 5 year old HP laptop with 3rd gen i5 processor. This has a  7th gen i3 processor & still it's not even half good as my old one.The system lags , ALWAYS.Takes a lot of time to process any operations.I made a fresh install of windows 10 by created a recovery media & it's a bit better than how it used to be.I realized this is a faulty product but i was late by that time. the last date for return has already completed 2 days before that. So now i'm stuck with this super slow laptop, No where to go..and the worst thing.. RAM has only 1 slot with 4Gb, can't upgrade.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-14q-cs0006TU/product-reviews/B07FMVPJ2F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

107	7 November 2018	Pretty good under 25k	4.0	Purchased this Lappy for my Wife at the Amazon Sale for 23k after applying all discounts. I would say it is pretty good for the price. Looks sleek and slim, is light to carry around, screen display and sound is also good. Battery Life is pretty good at around 6+ Hrs. There is no fast charging though. As stated by others, performance is a slight issue. It is not fast or snappy and can take few seconds to launch apps. To get around it, i have added 4 GB Crucial 2400 RAM in Dual Channel and increased it to 8 GB. Though it is a challenge to remove the Back Cover to insert the RAM. HP has not made it end user friendly. Now, it responds better than before. Please do consider upgrading RAM to get around the slowness issue. Overall, it is a good laptop for doing basic tasks and light office work.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-14q-cs0006TU/product-reviews/B07FMVPJ2F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

110	1 January 2019	This last is WORST THAN HELL  in capital latters	1.0	This laptop has 7th generation i3 processor with 4gb ram and 1tb HDD, still from the first usage only I found that this laptop is 20 times slower than my 5 year old Pentium Lenovo laptop.Once you make the payment your payments also gets strucked with Amazon and also the policy is not at all customer friendly, they will not initiate refunds so that you can buy a new and different model if u want, you will have to settle down with the same model. I will be getting that same model again today, hope my 31000/- bucks does not go in drain as Amazon has confirmed that the 2nd product but same model will be working great. They said they will ensure this. I hope I don't have to go through the same pain and agony again.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-14q-cs0006TU/product-reviews/B07FMVPJ2F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0
111	4 October 2019	Good Laptop. But No MS Office	1.0	The Laptop has a decent display, boots fast and does what it should for the price. However, the Microsoft Office mentioned in the listing is a 30-day trial version. However, the vendor conveniently mentions that Microsoft Office is available without providing any hints that it is a trial version.When I called up Amazon Customer Support. I was told -1. The Product only has a 30-day trial and that this has been clarified in an User Answer. There are 4 products and 3 user answers. Completely not appropriate2. I was asked to purchase the license for 8k.This is a complete cause of Deceptive Advertisements by the vendor.	https://www.amazon.in/HP-14-inch-Laptop-Windows-14q-cs0023TU/product-reviews/B07X7JH41Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

115	14 June 2019	Ok for just browsing.	3.0	This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price.

I contacted amazon for return but they told me a 10-12 step solution to make laptop faster which I implemented. The laptop did become a tad bit faster but returned to being the speed of the first generation computers in the world.Now I am frustrated using it and would highly recommend to not buy this laptop.I don't know if Amazon can help here.

124	25 July 2019	Poor performance	1.0	Very poor performance and pathetic service from Amazon.  I bought this laptop around 15th July. Just after three days the laptop got very very slow and booting itself takes ten mins. Researching more about this laptop, i found that this laptop has a history of bad processor and Amazon dupes this by providing top rated review in the reviews section. Have been calling Amazon customer support daily since last 7 days in vain. They either give a very vague answer like you don't have same card box in the product was delivered or simply cancel the return. Avoid purchasing this model on Amazon as it comes down to our luck whether the laptop works or not and you will be left with no one to help. It's good for nothing just like Amazon customer care. Go for i5 and 8gb.	https://www.amazon.in/Dell-Vostro-3480-14-inch-Graphics/product-reviews/B07WL4RB1X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

148	25 July 2019	Do not buy (Display problem noticed after 45 days of purchase): Problem not rectified satisfactorily	1.0	"Review on 30th November 2019: After getting the unit serviced!1. I had to send several emails to F1 Solutions and iLife digital, USA regarding the problem in the monitor.2. I was even ready to approach consumer court for the deficiency in service.3. They informed me that they have changed the display.4. But still it has the same patch but with lighter intensity. - When I mentioned this while taking over the unit, the service person told me that all the back-lit monitors will have such patch - Cheating is it not?Review on 12th October 2019: Approximately 10 days after sending the unit to service representative F1 Solutions:1. The F1 Solutions are not able to get the screen replaced since they say that they do not have stock.2. The worst part is that they ask us to contact iLife Digital directly.3. More worst part is that they even do not know how to contact iLife Digital?????  Pathetic is it not?Better not to purchase the iLife Digital products.Review on 10th Sept. 2019, approximately 45 days after purchase:1. There is a problem in the monitor. Rectangular white patch appears on the screen. Photo can be seen.2. When charging the backside of the monitor gets heated up sufficiently high.3. Unable to contact any customer service since there are no details available.Purchased the Life Digital Zed Air Ultra Laptop and it arrived today (25/7/2019).The first impression:Good Looking, Small in size, Light weight.Packaging was fine.Laptop (11.6"", 32 GB with 2GB DDR3 RAM) preloaded with windows 10. Usable space was 17 GB only.Speed is less, One has to rely on online ""One Drive"" for microsoft Office.Might be useful only for power-point, word etc, watching movies in internet and using for very limited purposes."	https://www.amazon.in/Life-Digital-Air-Ultra-11-6-inch/product-reviews/B07T22MZM9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0
149	17 September 2019	Display problem.	3.0	I received the laptop after two days I noticed rectangular box on the display(see the photo)  and it was replaced with new one. When I start new laptop display is ok but after two days again same problem on the display.  Probably all laptops in this model may have this defect. But it cannot be noticed while playing videos. I don't know in future whether it will become worse or not.	https://www.amazon.in/Life-Digital-Air-Ultra-11-6-inch/product-reviews/B07T22MZM9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0
150	23 August 2019	Avoid	1.0	"Update after 2months of usage: there is a visible rectangular mark on screen, which others have also reported. The charger is cheap quality, stopped working. contacted amazon customer care for manufacturer details as the product is under warranty. Amazon customer care says they don't have any details and said that I should instead ""search it on Google"". So helpful, isn't it?Writing this review after one week of usage. A well-performing laptop within 12k, extremely light weight and looks great, comfortable to work, full HD 1920x1080 display but not antiglare, keyboard is good but without backlight. USB 3.0. Responsive eMMC gives speed performance. battery backup is good (more than 10 hours for standby or offline work, 4-5 hours for online work). Storage an issue but can be added through SD card, so requires around 1k additional expenditure. Windows updates should be immediately turned off to save the previous 15-17 GB space left for usage. Overall a worthy purchase if you need a second laptop."	https://www.amazon.in/Life-Digital-Air-Ultra-11-6-inch/product-reviews/B07T22MZM9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0

177	27 January 2019	Horribly disappointed after 7 moths of use	1.0	First of all the performance was nothing to write home about.I spent more time downloading and installing updates than actually using the laptop.It was dead slow too. It altogether stoppedworking after 7 months. I contacted HP customer care and they advised software recovery.I tried the steps advised by them still it is not booting.The product is still under warranty and it was used only for online classes and basic browsing IE, no gaming or other heavy stuff.I requested a service visit but they declined saying that for software issues service visit can not be arranged.I don't know what is the use of Guarantee and buying a licensed Windows version .As I am living at a remote place with no nearby service centre,I am left with no option other than dumping the item with this kind of support from HP.Should serve as as eye opener for any one planning to go for an HP laptop.After almost one month the laptop is still not repaired.Should serve as an indicator of the much pom-pom Ed HP service.My advise is please desist from buying this crapUpdate:Now HP says the defect is on hard disk. The service engineer replaced the hard disk. However the USB media I bought from HP shelling out Rs. 1100 is not working. Finally the service engineer installed windows by cloud recovery. (however HP has promised a free replacement of the recovery media). Subsequently the keypad started functioning erratically. The lappy is still at the service centre. I don't know  what to make of the whole process	https://www.amazon.in/HP-15-6-inch-Windows-Natural-15-DA0326TU/product-reviews/B07FV57FC1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0
